Many of the case examples are drawn from social work practitioners as well as the authors&#39; own practice situations. Long praised for its appropriate level of rigor, the book integrates the major theories and skills that direct social work practitioners need to understand and master--thus giving the book its reputation as the classic source for helping students learn direct practice skills. Consisting of four parts, the book begins by identifying the mission of social work, its values, and knowledge base. The authors then differentiate generalist from direct practice and explore roles of direct practitioners. Common elements amongst diverse theorists are then examined while key intervention strategies and various client population and practice settings are presented. Specifically, Part One provides the foundational/values and knowledge base material; Part Two is devoted to the beginning phase of the helping process; Part Three addresses the middle phase (goal attainment strategies), discussing four intervention approaches; and Part Four clarifies the termination phase of direct practice.</p><p>Highly respected social work educators, Dean H. Hepworth and Jo Ann Larsen originally defined how direct practice should be taught."This text is a comprehensive, well-written and effective tool for social work students in the foundation year. It provides an overview of the helping profess, underscored by the values and ethics of the profession, and proceeds through the helping stages with theories, skills development, case examples and classroom exercises that are clearly presented, offer diverse perspectives, and challenge the beginning practitioner. The continuous process of updating the literature and timely additions assures me that topics of importance to social work practitioners will be addressed. The access to InfoTrac and the Internet exercises are additional features that make this text desirable."<br><br>"I believe this is one of the best textbooks available for this course."</p><h2>Kem Weber, Designer and Architect</h2><p><b>The first major look at the renowned industrial designer and architect, who helped to shape the look of American modernism from the 1920s through the early 1950s</b><br><br> For German-born Kem Weber (1889&#x2013;1963), design was not about finding a new expression; it was about responding to &#x201c;structural, economic, and social requirements . . . characteristic of our daily routine of living.&#x201d; He sought to ensure that each design he produced&#x2014;whether a piece of furniture or a building or an interior&#x2014;was an improvement that responded to modern needs and modern life. Weber was a leading figure of modernism on the West Coast from the 1920s through the early 1950s, and his work greatly influenced the California style of the time. His most iconic designs were his Bentlock line, the Air Line chair, the interiors for the Bixby House, and his tubular-steel furniture for Lloyd.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book, a result of significant new primary research in the Weber family&#x2019;s archives, represents the first major study of the life and career of this important designer.&nbsp; Christopher Long details the full range of Weber&#x2019;s contributions, focusing particularly on the part he played in the advancement of American modernism, and his role in heralding a new way of making and living.</p><p>This groundbreaking study is the first major look at industrial designer and architect Kem Weber, who greatly influenced modern American design from the 1920s through the early 1950s.<b>Christopher Long </b>is professor and chair of history/theory at the University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The tragedy of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark (Folger Shakespeare Library)</h2><p>"Each edition includes: "<p>- Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play</p><p>- Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play</p><p>- Scene-by-scene plot summaries</p><p>- A key to famous lines and phrases</p><p>- An introduction to reading Shakespeare's language</p><p>- An essay by an outstanding scholar providing a modern perspective on the play</p><p>- Illustrations from the Folger Shakespeare Library's vast holdings of rare books</p><p>"Essay by" Michael Neill</p><p>The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., is home to the world's largest collection of Shakespeare's printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

He is often called England's national poet, and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.</p><h2>The Practice Of Emotionally Focused Marital Therapy: Creating Connection</h2><p><p>This work serves as a clear, cogent description of the process of emotionally focused marital therapy (EFT) - which, at the same time, illuminates the promise this technique offers. While most of the literature in this area is based on the idea of intervention being primarily behavioral (with emotion considered as secondary at best, and disruptive at worst) this book identifies the role of emotion in marital distress, and then reveals its potential to play a central role in successful marital therapy. The Practice of Emotionally Focused Marital Therapy includes: A model for short-term, effective marital therapy Relevant theory of adult love and marital stress Change strategies with many clinical examples Nine steps in the process of change, together with key change events Step-by-step guide to intervention at specific points in therapy Specific ways to address a partners emotions to create new interactions and bonding events Applications of techniques with families This important new volume presents EFT as a powerful therapeutic technique for practicing professionals, and also serves as an instructive graduate-level text for courses in marital therapy, psychology, social work, and counselling.</p></p><p></p><h2>Contemporary Precalculus: A Graphing Approach (with CD-ROM, BCA/iLrn&#x2122; Tutorial, and InfoTrac) (Available Titles CengageNOW)</h2><p>Thomas Hungerford&#39;s CONTEMPORARY PRECALCULUS text is highly praised and well respected for its clear writing, outstanding applications problems, and integration of technology.

Creating his own desert garden behind his suburban home in Tempe, Arizona, Alcock scrutinizes every square inch of soil detailing the exotic plant life he finds and offering tips on its peccadilloes and preservation.<br><br> The true heroes of this story, however, are the bugs of Alcock's backyard. We are drawn into complex plots almost biblical in nature of life and love, survival and death. Two male earwigs caught in each other's pincers battle for a prized female. A female mantis finishes copulating, beheads her mate, and cannibalizes his body for its precious protein.<br><br> With each detail, Alcock pieces together the entire ecosystem of his desert paradise. Always amusing and instructive, and sometimes dramatic, <em>In a Desert Garden</em> provides an eye-opening meditation on the joys of planting, weeding, pruning, and, most of all, bug-hunting.</p><p>When John Alcock replaced the Bermuda grass in his suburban Arizona lawn with gravel, cacti, and fairy dusters, he was doing more than creating desert landscaping. He seeded his property with flowers to entice certain insects and even added a few cowpies to attract termites, creating a personal laboratory for ecological studies. His observations of life in his own front yard provided him with the fieldnotes for this unusual book. &#34;In a Desert Garden&#34; draws readers into the strange and fascinating world of plants and animals native to Arizona&#39;s Sonoran Desert. As Alcock studies the plants in his yard, he shares thoughts on planting, weeding, and pruning that any gardener will appreciate. And when commenting on the mating rituals of spiders and beetles or marveling at the camouflage of grasshoppers and caterpillars, he uses humor and insight to detail the lives of the insects that live in his patch of desert. Celebrating the virtues of even aphids and mosquitoes, Alcock draws the reader into the intricacies of desert life to reveal the complex interactions found in this unique ecosystem. &#34;In a Desert Garden&#34; combines meticulous science with contemplations of nature and reminds us that a world of wonder lies just outside our own doors.John Alcock, a specialist in the ecology of the American Southwest, introduces us to the lives and loves of desert insects as they forage through his backyard oasis. Two male earwigs caught in each other&#39;s pincers battle for a prized female. A female mantis finishes copulating, beheads her mate, and cannibalizes his body for its precious protein. Soaring above, a retinue of drone honey bees pursue their queen on her nuptial flight. The one who succeeds in mating with her will fertilize up to ten thousand eggs. With each gritty detail, Alcock pieces together the entire ecosystem of his desert paradise. We discover the chains of survival that link species - how a simple compost heap becomes a complex ecology of beetles, wasps, worms, and birds.</p><h2>March&#39;s Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure</h2><p><p>The new, revised and updated 7th edition of <i>March&#x2019;s Advanced Organic Chemistry</i> clearly explains the theories and examples of organic chemistry, providing the most comprehensive resource about organic chemistry available.</p> <p>Readers are guided on planning and execution of multi-step synthetic reactions, with detailed descriptions of all the reactions.&nbsp;The first five chapters deal with the structure of organic compounds and&nbsp;discuss important organic chemistry bonds, fundamental principles of conformation, and stereochemistry of organic molecules, and reactive intermediates in organic chemistry.&nbsp;Chapters 6 to 9 are concerned with general principles of mechanism in organic chemistry, including acids and bases, photochemistry, sonochemistry and microwave irradiation, and finally the relationship between structure and reactivity.&nbsp;The last 10 chapters cover the nature and the scope of organic reactions and their mechanisms.</p> <p>The&nbsp;7th edition proves again it is a must-have desktop reference and textbook for every student and professional working in organic chemistry or related fields.</p> <p><b>Key features of the 7th edition:</b></p> <ul> <li>Every chapter has been updated with the most recent reaction information with references to both the primary and review literature</li> <li>New to the&nbsp;7th edition: 5,500 references since the last edition, updates / rewrites of the retained sections, and an updated index in Appendix B</li> <li>Contains more than 1650 reactions&nbsp;and 20,000 valuable references to the primary literature</li> <li>Includes appendices on the literature of organic chemistry and the classification of reactions according to the compounds synthesized</li> <li>Guides the reader on planning and execution of multi-step synthetic reactions, with detailed descriptions of all the reactions.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><b>Reviews of the previous edition:</b></p> <p>"...a favorite general organic chemistry text and an easy-to-use one-volume reference.

Nearly six decades later, as an old man in Madrid, his frescoes of cosmic proportions for the Royal Palace awed the Spanish court. Sheer industry and confidence in his artistic mission sustained this Venetian master. His aim was to create an alternative universe of light and color; he saw light as divine, and it gave clarity and vitality to his images. Claiming to be the first full-length book on Tiepolo to be written in English, this splendidly illustrated study by the director of London's National Gallery shows us many sides of an artist who could be broadly comic or solemn and didactic. His caricaturesbizarre etchings of Punchinellos and dwarf-like humansare the mellow musings of a sage. His landscapes reveal meticulous observation of nature. Born in Venice when it was still the capital of an empire, this socially conservative artist blazed a uniquely personal style that was quintessentially Venetian. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Avedon Advertising</h2><p><b>The first survey of Richard Avedon&#x2019;s influential advertising work&nbsp;</b><br><br> Richard Avedon was one of the most sought-after and influential advertising photographers in America from the 1940s to the beginning of the 21st century, creating work that exemplified Madison Avenue at the height of its influence in world culture.

Only when they forgot this aspect of their identity did these nations begin to decline. Recognizing that the United States and China are modern naval powers&#x2014;rather than seapowers&#x2014;is essential to understanding&nbsp;current affairs, as well as the long-term trends in world history. This volume is a highly original &#x201c;big think&#x201d; analysis of five states whose success&#x2014;and eventual failure&#x2014;is a subject of enduring interest, by a scholar at the top of his game.</p><p><b>Andrew Lambert</b> is Laughton Professor of Naval History at King&#x2019;s College London, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.&#x201c;<i>Seapower States</i> is an intriguing series of stories of communities thinking seriously about how to stand their own ground when outpowered, how to do so in ways that are consistent with their values, and sometimes how to negotiate the descent from being a great power when the cards just aren&#x2019;t in their favour any more.These are timely questions.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sarah Kinkel, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br>&#x201c;I admire the author's ambition and verve, the fluency of his writing, the audacity of some of his insights, the unquenchability of his commitment and the brilliance with which he uses art as evidence.&#x201d;&#x2014;Felipe Fernandez Armesto, <i>Literary Review</i><br>&#x201c;<i>Seapower States</i> presents, along with a fascinating geopolitical chronicle, &#x2018;the history of an idea, and its transmission across time&#x2019; . . .

Through actual fighting, provision of supplies, and money, Spain helped the young British colonies succeed in becoming an independent nation. Soldiers were recruited from all over the Spanish empire, from Spain itself and from throughout Spanish America. Many died fighting British soldiers and their allies in Central America, the Caribbean, along the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis and as far north as Michigan, along the Gulf Coast to Mobile and Pensacola, as well as in Europe.<p>Based on primary research in the archives of Spain, this book is about United States history at its very inception, placing the war in its broadest international context. In short, the information in this book should provide a clearer understanding of the independence of the United States, correct a longstanding omission in its history, and enrich its patrimony. It will appeal to anyone interested in the history of the Revolutionary War and in Spain&#x2019;s role in the development of the Americas.</p></p><p>A thorough study of how Spain contributed to the Revolutionary War in America.Thomas E.

This book describes these therapies and includes self-care and home remedies, such as self-massage, magnet therapy, moxibustion, Chinese aromatherapy, Chinese patent medicines, and herbal teas.</p><p>Insomnia is such a widespread disorder that it seemed to us a natural subject for inclusion in our &#34;Curing&#34; series. We hope these self-help tips will help more people sleep better.This is another of my series of &#34;Curing&#34; books. These are all books that I have written specifically to help laypersons understand the theory and benefits of Chinese medicine. Each book deals with a particular, commonly seen disease or group of diseases, and in each book, I try my hardest to make Chinese medicine understandable to people who have never been exposed to it before. Chinese medicine is a completely separate and different system of medicine from modern Western medicine, and all the things we learned in high school biology are of little use in understanding this system. However, if the reader is willing to set aside all their preconceived notions about human physiology and disease, I believe they will find that Chinese medicine provides very wise, compassionate, and empowering explanation of why we get sick and what we can do about it. Although people don&#39;t usually die from insomnia, those with severe, intractable insomnia sometimes wish they could die. The good news is that Chinese medicine has a whole host of simple, safe, low or no cost home remedies to treat insomnia. And, no matter whether professionally administered or done at home, Chinese medical treatments are designed to cure without side effects. So if your frustrated by having to use sedatives and tranquilizers, I suggest you give Chinese medicine a try.</p><h2>All New Backyard Idea Book (Taunton&#39;s Idea Book Series)</h2><p><p><strong>Completely revised and updated edition of the best-seller</strong> The<strong><em> All New Backyard Idea Book</em></strong> has been completely updated to bring together hundreds of fresh ideas and unique solutions for making the most of any backyard or outdoor spaces.

The <i>Metamorphoses </i>has been more widely illustrated than any other book except the Bible; for centuries, great artists have drawn, painted, and sculpted its stories, the artists often responding not only to Ovid&#x2019;s work but to one another&#x2019;s in their depictions. &nbsp;Paul Barolsky, a specialist in Italian Renaissance art and literature, explores Ovid&#x2019;s unparalleled influence on the visual arts, discussing works by many of the most famous artists of the past six centuries.&nbsp; Broadly interdisciplinary, the new understanding of the themes of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> revealed here will appeal to those in the fields of Renaissance art, humanism, literature, history, and classics, among others.&nbsp; At once witty, entertaining, and profound, <i>Ovid and the Metamorphoses of Modern Art from Botticelli to Picasso</i> is a meditation on what words can achieve that images cannot, and conversely what images can show that words cannot tell.</p><p>Written in the spirit of Ovid, this lively and erudite book traces the art derived from Ovid&#x2019;s <i>Metamorphoses </i>from the Renaissance up to the present day.<br><b>Paul Barolsky </b>is professor of art history at the University of Virginia.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Natural Geography of Plants</h2><p>The Natural Geography of Plants [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Reading Mastery Reading/Literature Strand Grade K, Teacher Guide</h2><p>For more than thirty-five years, Reading Mastery has been helping young learners become smarter, learn to read faster and develop effective strategies for understanding.

First to use the concept of speed as a definining concept for contemporary civilization, Virilio unveils his theories of dromodology here for the first time. Understanding the disappearance of power into a vector of speed where knowledge-power is eliminated to the benefit of moving-power, Virilio discovers the new terrain of &#34;virtual&#34; war long before its popularization in the Gulf War of the early 1990s. Building on the work of Morand, Marinetti, and McLuhan, Virilio presents a vision more radical politically than that of any of his French contemporaries. Speed as the engine of destruction....In these pages the reader surveys dromocratic aesthetics with its eloquent X-ray of speed flesh, speed wars, speed power, and speed fetishism. This work prevents the reader from becoming the &#34;last man&#34; drifting in all those &#34;metabolic vehicles.&#34;</p><p>Paul Virilio is considered the most important theorist of technology since Heidegger.

The Gothic novel, featuring dark tales of tragedy, romance, revenge, torture and ancient villainies, tinged with horror and the supernatural, became the vogue in the late eighteen and early nineteenth centuries. This unique collection presents the best and the most diverse of this fascinating genre. In Horace Walpole s The Castle of Otranto, often regarded as the first true Gothic romance, we have a template for such works, which other writers adopted and adapted. With its dark cruelties and fiercely passionate dramas, the power of Walpole s prose remains magically potent today. In Vathek William Beckford developed the form further, introducing Orientalism to the Gothic mix of horror and mystery, creating the finest European imitation of the Arabian Nights. With his novel Nightmare Abbey, Thomas Love Peacock satirises the format to great comic effect while still retaining the essential chilling elements. This fantastic collection runs the gamut of Gothic fiction, presenting an entertaining and a thrilling overview of the genre.</p><p></p><h2>The Good Person Of Szechwan (Student Editions)</h2><p><p>'Brecht's dark, dazzling world-view...makes an absolutely devastating impact.

To gradually release responsibility is to equip students with what they need to be engaged and self-directed learners. On a day-to-day level, it means delivering lessons purposefully planned to incorporate four essential and interrelated instructional phases: <br><br>1. Focused Instruction: Preparing students for learning by establishing lesson purpose, modeling strategies and skills, thinking aloud, and noticing how students respond. <br>2. Guided Instruction: Strategically using prompts, cues, and questions to lead students to new understanding.<br>3. Collaborative Learning: Allowing students to consolidate their understanding through exploration, problem-solving, discussion, and thinking with their peers. <br>4. Independent Learning: Requiring students to use the skills and knowledge they've acquired to create authentic products and ask new questions.<br><br>The authors explore each phase, using real-life examples from a variety of disciplines. You'll find tips and tools for classroom implementation, including checklists for planning and assessment; advice on feedback, homework, group work, differentiated instruction, and blended learning; answers to frequently asked questions; and examples that align to Common Core State Standards.

What emerges is a highly informative look at the religious, political, and social spheres of the modern Islamic world. Naturally, readers will find many entries on topics of intense current interest, such as terrorism and the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, the PLO and HAMAS. But the coverage goes well beyond recent headlines. There are biographical profiles, ranging from Naguib Mahfouz (the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt) to Malcolm X, including political leaders, influential thinkers, poets, scientists, and writers. Other entries cover major political movements, militant groups, and religious sects as well as terms from Islamic law, culture, and religion, key historical events, and important landmarks (such as Mecca and Medina). A series of entries looks at Islam in individual nations, such as Afghanistan, the West Bank and Gaza, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the United States, and there are discussions of Islamic views on such issues as abortion, birth control, the Internet, the Rushdie Affair, and the theory of evolution.<br> Whether we are listening to the evening news, browsing through the op-ed pages, or reading a book on current events, references to Muslims and the Islamic world appear at every turn. <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Islam</em> offers a wealth of information for anyone curious about this burgeoning and increasingly important world religion.</p><p><br><strong>John L.

A past president of the Middle East Studies Association, he is Editor-in-Chief of the four-volume <em>Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World</em>, Editor of <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of Islam</em>, and the author of numerous books, including <em>Islam: The Straight Path, Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam,</em> and <em>What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam</em>. He lives in Washington, D.C.<br>In this volume "designed for general readers with little or no knowledge of Islam," more than 2,000 alphabetically arranged entries treat "the religion of Islam and its impact on history, politics, and society." Editor Esposito also edited the four-volume <i>Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World</i> (1995), from which the new work extracts and updates material. Recent developments are reflected in the entries <i>Bin Laden, Osama;</i> <i>HAMAS;</i> <i>Palestine Liberation Organization</i> (PLO); <i>Qaeda, al-;</i> and <i>Taliban.</i> There are also entries that describe Islam in various countries and regions, while the religious foundation of Islam is treated in the entries <i>Pillars of Islam</i> and <i>Quran.</i> The Islamic perspective on topics such as abortion and homosexuality is also provided. Although the focus is on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the inclusion of important persons and places in the history of Islam broadens the scope of the work.<p>The goal of creating a compact resource for the general reader may account for the lack of features such as supplemental bibliographies and an index. Cross-referencing isi nsufficient. The entry for <i>Pillars of Islam</i> has no <i>see</i> reference from "Five Pillars," a name by which they are also commonly known. Further, this entry fails to point the reader to the entries for each of the individual pillars, something an index and <i>see also</i> references could easily accomplish. </p><p>The standard reference tool for Islam is the ongoing <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam</i> (Brill, 1954-). Densely academic, it is beyond the scope of many libraries and contains little in the way of contemporary issues. Another option is the single-volume <i>The New Encyclopedia of Islam</i> (AltaMira, 2001), which includes suggestions for further reading, illustrations, and better cross-references, though it, too, lacks an index and bibliographies for entries. </p><p>World events have sparked a keen interest in Islam.

Philip Yancey realized that despite a lifetime attending Sunday school topped off by a Bible college education, he really had no idea who Jesus was. In fact, he found himself further and further removed from the person of Jesus, distracted instead by flannel-graph figures and intellectual inspection. He determined to use his journalistic talents to approach Jesus, in the context of time, within the framework of history.<p> In <i>The Jesus I Never Knew</i>, Yancey explores the life of Jesus, as he explains, "'from below,' to grasp as best I can what it must have been like to observe in person the extraordinary events unfolding in Galilee and Judea" as Jesus traveled and taught. Yancey examines three fundamental questions: who Jesus was, why he came, and what he left behind. Step by step, scene by scene, Yancey probes the culture into which Jesus was born and grew to adulthood; his character and mission; his teachings and miracles; his legacy--not just as history has told it, but as he himself intended it to be. </p><p> Yancey is not alone in his examination of the "real" Jesus. Publishing today is replete with writers committed to setting the story "straight,quot; joining countless others who, over the past 2,000 years, have determined to discover the truth about Jesus. But where others would deconstruct and discount, Yancey disarms and discloses. We become colleagues with him as he examines the accounts of the life of Jesus. And among the things that we discover is that Jesus himself leaves us few options: either he was who he said he was or he was nuts. </p><p> Philip Yancey was awarded the Gold Medallion Christian Book of the Year award for this book in 1996 by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association. It's not the first, nor the last, award Yancey has won for his writing. But the writing is not necessarily the great gift of this book. Yancey allows the reader to discover, along with him, <i>The Jesus I Never Knew</i>. <i>--Patricia Klein</i></p>Andrew Lloyd Webber cast him as a rock-n-roll rebel in the musical Jesus Christ Superstar, many Christians see him as a handsome European-looking man, and social justice groups place him next to Ghandi in his defense of the downtrodden. But, says Philip Yancey, the real Jesus would have left most people scratching their heads along with the disciples and asking, "Who is this guy?" <p>This is exactly the question Yancey asks in his new book The Jesus I Never Knew. Yancey's search for the real Jesus collides with the calm, cool, collected, and "loving hippie" notions of Jesus he saw in modern American culture. Instead, he finds a Galilean Jew born into apparent scandal making the most daring of claims: that he is the Way, the Truth, and the Light. </p><p>The Jesus I Never Knew developed out of a class Yancey led at LaSalle Street Church in Chicago, but finding the real Jesus has been Yancey's passion since childhood. </p><p>Yancey saw Him as a cardboard cut-out in Sunday School and a "cosmic Christ" in Bible college. Today he sees a world that marks its calendar around Jesus' birth and uses His name to intensify a curse. (Wouldn't it be odd to center a calendar around Napoleon's birth or to scream "Thomas Jefferson" in a shocking situation?). </p><p>"And yet," says Yancey, "I am not writing a book about Jesus because he is a great man who changed history. I am not tempted to write about Julius Caesar or the Chinese emperor who built the great wall. I am drawn to Jesus, irresistibly, because he has positioned himself at the dividing point of life-my life." </p><p>The Jesus I Never Knew looks at who Jesus was, why he came, and what he left behind. More than historical speculation or doctrinal recitation, Yancey asks the questions out of a personal desire to truly know Jesus. </p><p>"The Jesus I Knew has to be the greatest book I've read on the subject."

Balch explains the vital roles of vitamins and minerals in the body and describes specific actions that foods can take. Illustrations. 30 charts.</p><p>As Hippocrates said, "Leave your drugs in the chemist's pot if you can heal the patient with food." Seems people didn't listen to him, because as the U.S. Surgeon General said more than 2,000 years after him, "Two-thirds of all deaths in 1997 in this country could be attributed to diet." They'd both likely advocate the information contained in <i>Prescription for Dietary Wellness</i>, a massive reference aimed at preventing and treating disease through diet. The Balchs, authors of the 3-million-plus bestseller <i>Prescription for Nutritional Healing</i>, which focuses mainly on supplements and herbs, have created another masterpiece. This book gives a solid education in nutrition basics, with references to the latest research. It also includes flavorful, antioxidant-packed recipes, and adds advice that has been proven effective for treating various ailments using specific foods and supplements. The book also includes: <ul><li>Charts with warning signs of disease and nutrient deficiency, along with guidelines to help start the healing process </li><li>Charts that detail the nutrient needs of various organs, and which foods best supply the nutrients </li><li>Lengthy chapters on specific categories of foods, such as beans, cruciferous vegetables, oils, and grains, explaining how best to cook them and the health benefits they confer </li><li>More than 100 pages of quick, healthy, mostly low-fat recipes designed to pack the most nutritional punch for the calories</li></ul> The Balchs add advice about live juice and herbal preparations and cleansing (i.e., fasting and enemas, including a specific six-day cleansing diet). While this guide can feel a bit overwhelming at times (there are so many nutrients to consider, so many veggies and whole grains to consume), it's certainly not too technical, even for folks who could use a copy of <i>Nutrition for Dummies</i>, and it certainly succeeds in its mission of helping foster better dietary habits for good health.James F.

But the product is only the end of a story that is full of fascinating questions. What has been the social and cultural role of design in American society? To produce useful things that consumers need? Or to persuade them to buy things they don't need? Where does the designer stand in all of this? And how has the role of design in America changed over time, since the early days of the young Republic?<br> Jeffrey Meikle explores the history of American design, from the hand-crafted furniture and artifacts of the early nineteenth century, through the era of industrialization and the mass production of the machine age, to the information-based society of the present, covering everything from the Arts and Crafts movement to Art Deco, modernism to post-modernism, the MOMA to the Tupperware bowl. Beautifully illustrated, <em>Design in the USA</em> also includes suggestions for further reading, a timeline, and a list of relevant museums and web sites.

Our undivided attention is something we are rarely able to give for reasons ranging from digital overload to the cultural conditioning of equating busyness with purpose. Just as you might choose a fast from eating to detoxify the body, the best way to overcome this modern mental overload is to periodically fast the mind.<br><br>Drawing on the spiritual philosophies and meditative practices of classical yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism, Jason Gregory explains how fasting the mind directly impacts your habits and way of being in the world to create peace and calmness in your life as well as allow you to build a firm psychological defense against the increasing bombardment of distractions in our world. Applying psychology and cognitive science to samsara--the cycle of suffering created by our attachment to the impermanent--he explains how overreliance on the rational mind causes imbalances in the autonomic nervous system and suppresses our natural spontaneity, feelings, and intuition. When we are unable to relax the mind deeply, we enter a destabilizing state of stress and anxiety and are unable to liberate the true Self from the impermanence and limitations of the material world. Sharing Zen, Taoist, and Vedic practices to help you empty your mind and gradually restore your natural rhythms, the author shows how to give the mind time to truly relax from stimulation so it can repair itself and come back into equilibrium. He details simple meditation practices that are easy to implement in daily life, such as open-awareness meditation and contemplation of Zen koans, as well as the advanced techniques of Vipassana, a Theravadic Buddhist discipline centered on seclusion from all worldly stimuli. He also offers methods for digital detox and ensuring a good night&#x2019;s sleep, a major support for healing cognitive impairment and restoring a state of equanimity.<br><br>By fasting the mind we strip away the distractions and stresses of modern life and return to our original nature as it exists deep within. We become more consciously awake in every moment, allowing us to feel the real beauty of the world and, in turn, to live life more fully, authentically, and peacefully.</p><p>Jason Gregory is a teacher and international speaker specializing in the fields of Eastern and Western philosophy, comparative religion, metaphysics, and ancient cultures. For several years he studied with masters in Buddhism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Hinduism, and Taoism, traveling to some of the most remote places in the world.

It requires immense discipline and a transformation of lifestyle. But paradoxically it is not hard at all; it is the easiest thing in the world to accomplish because your true nature is an empty liberated mind. This ancient art of healing brings you back to the present moment, where you&#x2019;ve always been in reality, and away from the illusion of past and future, which have clouded this reality. The ease we feel in life from a liberated mind is living in accord with our original enlightened nature, what I call &#x201c;Zen in life.&#x201d; <br><br><b>ZEN IN LIFE</b> <br><br>Indian spiritual guru and yoga adept Swami Satchidananda once said that enlightenment is not some fantastic event, but rather it is an ease we feel when we have stepped out of the murk of the personality and into the light of God. This ease comes because the contracted aspect of onsciousness we know as &#x201c;I&#x201d; has been downregulated. This frees us to live in the world without being a prisoner to our personality&#x2019;s perception of the world. We see things as they truly are without labeling or naming the experience and what we are experiencing. <br><br>It is definitely beneficial to practice an art of spiritual cultivation, such as hatha yoga, t&#x2019;ai chi, or a monastic lifestyle, but eventually you need to walk Zen in life, to live the purpose of a spiritual practice. To be Zen in life is not just about meditation, but instead life has become meditation, in the sense that our illusory perceptions of separation have disappeared, allowing us to experience the nondual, innate beauty of all life. <br><br><b>DIGITAL DETOX <br></b><br>Fasting the mind is about starving the mind from the habitual comforts that tend to distract us from enlightenment. If you are constantly on a digital device, phone, computer, television, etc., there is no chance for your mind to reach equanimity. For example, how many of you have been on a digital device before bed and then toss and turn for hours? In recent times our sleeping patterns are out of sync, and insomnia is on the rise as a result of too much digital stimulation. In Chinese Taoism you are out of sync with nature&#x2019;s rhythm when you are engaged in yang (masculine/active) activities at night because nighttime is for yin (feminine/receptive) energy, for rest and shutting down sense activity. If you engage in yang activities at night your mind becomes agitated and ready for action because it thinks it is the beginning of the day when yang is naturally high. <br><br>Methods of countering digital bombardment are necessary components of fasting the mind. One such method is &#x201c;digital sunsets.&#x201d; Digital sunset was a phrase coined by American philosopher and optimal life coach Brian Johnson. When 6 p.m., or even better 5 p.m., comes around all devices are shut down. This method reminds us of the importance of talking to each other face to face, eye to eye, and is also about following our biological nature. Scientific research has revealed that the pineal gland, a pea-size organ in the brain commonly associated with our spiritual soul, begins to release melatonin a few hours before your regular bedtime, which reduces your alertness and makes sleep more inviting. But the blue light in digital devices can keep the pineal gland from releasing melatonin and ultimately mess with our sleep patterns.<br><br>When you practice digital sunsets for a long time, you will feel your mind and nervous system begin to be more calm and relaxed, even during the daytime. Sleep becomes much deeper and easy to fall into. Just this simple practice will do a lot to transform your lifestyle. The more time we spend away from digital screens, the more we come back in resonance with nature and her cyclical rhythm.<br><br><b>MASTERPIECE DAY <br></b><br>Many of the mental diseases and cultural problems in the world have arisen from consuming mental complexity and identifying with its contents. By becoming conscious of what we consume, we simplify our lives. Our personality needs to be downregulated, and this can be achieved in the everyday discipline of simplifying our habits and lifestyle. <br><br>Every day has the potential to be a masterpiece or a disaster, dependent on whether you are practicing mind fasting in your life or not. When we fast the mind, the complex components of distraction are weeded out. The art of living mind fasting in our lifestyle is about getting back to the basics. What do we essentially need? <br><br>There are four essential components for manifesting a masterpiece day: meditation, exercise, healthy diet, and adequate rest--in no particular order. These four fundamentals should be evenly distributed, not in time, but in energy as all four require different amounts of energy. We should not overcompensate for one at the expense of another. This is done far too often by most people, especially in regard to rest. Most people live an excessively active life but do not get adequate rest, which leads to all sorts of psychological problems. <br><br>Without adequate rest the three remaining fundamentals suffer. It is essential to let our nervous system completely shut down every day for at least seven, preferably eight, hours to function at an optimal level of well-being. If we do consistently get adequate rest, our life becomes extremely vibrant as we tap into an unbridled enthusiasm for anything life offers, enhancing our productivity naturally in a nonegotistical manner. Sleep is the power base for the other three fundamentals. If we consistently get enough sleep, our meditation practice becomes deeper and more vivid, with the ability to silence the mind for longer periods of time, and we have more energy for consistent exercise routines as well as more enthusiasm for eating healthy food regularly. <br><br>Following these four fundamental fasting the mind lifestyle disciplines will give you a firm foundation in your everyday experience that will naturally evoke health, well-being, and the secret element of creativity.</p><h2>Literacy Tools in the Classroom: Teaching Through Critical Inquiry, Grades 5-12 (Language and Literacy Series)</h2><p><p>This innovative resource describes how teachers can help students employ &#x201c;literacy tools&#x201d; across the curriculum to foster learning.

At the heart of this transformation lies what is often called a &#34;paradigm shift&#34;-a dramatic change in the thoughts, perceptions, and values which form a particular vision of reality. The paradigm that is now shifting comprises a large number of ideas and values that have dominated our society for several hundred years; values that have been associated with various streams of Western culture, among them the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century, The Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. They include the belief in the scientific method as the only valid approach to knowledge, the split between mind and matter, the view of nature as a mechanical system, the view of life in society as a competitive struggle for survival, and the belief in unlimited material progress to be achieved through economic and technological growth. All these ideas and values are now found to be severely limited and in need of radical revision.</p><p>Now available in softcover! <strong>`</strong>... invaluable for those wrestling with the nature of consciousness in transpersonal and humanistic and social psychology ...

This book is an intellectual biography of Winckelmann that discusses his magnum opus, <i>History of the Art of Antiquity</i>, in the context of his life and work in Germany and in Rome in the eighteenth century.<br><br>Alex Potts analyzes Winckelmann's eloquent account of the aesthetic and imaginative Greek ideal in art, an account that focuses on the political and homoerotic sexual content that gave the antique ideal male nude its larger resonance. He shows how Winckelmann's writing reflects the well-known preoccupations and values of Enlightenment culture as well as a darker aspect of Enlightenment ideals--such as the fantasy of a completely free sovereign subjectivity associated with Greek art. Potts explores how Winckelmann's historical perspective on the art of antiquity both prefigures and undermines the more strictly historicizing views put forward in the nineteenth century and how his systematic definition of style and historical development casts a new light on the present-day understanding of these notions. According to Potts, Winckelmann goes well beyond the simple rationalist art history and Neoclassical art theory with which he is usually associated. Rather, he often seems to speak directly to our present awareness of the discomforting ideological and psychic contradictions inherent in supposedly ideal symbolic forms.</p><p></p><h2>Genesis And Exodus</h2><p>One of the basic resource library&nbsp;books for the Disciple:&nbsp; Into&nbsp;The Word Into The World program that is used weekly by group members for reading, study, and research.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>Haiti: The Duvaliers and Their Legacy</h2><p>Recounts the depredations and corruption of the Duvalier regime in Haiti, detailing the excesses of both Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier and the grim state in which they left the country when the regime was finally overthrown</p><p>Written by the senior editor of the Haiti Times (and sister-in-law of Baby Doc's successor, General Henri Namphy), this is the most intimate and revealing examination to date of the Duvalier years. Based largely on interviews with former officials, intellectuals, voudou priests and ordinary folk, Abbott provides a shocking view of conditions in the Black Republic from the 1957 election of Duvalier pere to the exile of his son, Jean-Claude, in 1986, and up to the installation of President Leslie Manigat two years later. For the most part, it is a nightmarish chronicle of corruption, greed and relentless slaughter, climaxing in an account of "Blood Sunday" (29 November 1987) when the dreaded Tonton Macoutes reemerged to sabotage Haiti's first free election in 30 years. Abbott traces the transformation of Francois Duvalier from puritanical country doctor to mad despot, the rise of the Macoutes gangs under Madame Max Adolphe and their political rivalry with the Haitian army, and the bizarre, lackadaisical reign of Jean- Claude Duvalier, including details of the reckless squandering of public funds by his wife Michelle.

Wodehouse (1881-1975) was perhaps the most widely acclaimed British humorist of the twentieth century. Throughout his career, he brilliantly examined the complex and idiosyncratic nature of English upper-crust society with hilarious insight and wit. The works in this volume provide a wonderful introduction to Wodehouse&#x2019;s work and his unique talent for joining fantastic plots with authentic emotion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>The Code of the Woosters</i>, Wodehouse&#x2019;s most famous duo, Bertie Wooster and his unflappable valet Jeeves, risks all to steal a cream jug. <i>Uncle Fred in the Springtime</i>, part of the famous Blandings Castle series, follows Uncle Fred as he attempts to ruin the Duke of Blandings while he is preoccupied with his favorite pig.

In this expanded and updated edition of what has become a classic history of liberalism, Edmund Fawcett traces its ideals, successes, and failures through the lives and ideas of exemplary thinkers and politicians from the early nineteenth century to today. Significant revisions--including a new conclusion--reflect recent changes affecting the world political order that many see as presenting new and very potent threats to the survival of liberal democracy as we know it. A richly detailed account of a vulnerable but critically important political creed, this book reminds us that to defend liberalism it is vital to understand its character and history.</p></p><p><p>"In this wonderfully fluent tour through the history of modern liberal thinking, Edmund Fawcett examines a generous selection of important thinkers from the 1830s to our own time in a way that locates both the lineage of their political thinking and the politics of their times. Sharp analysis is combined with a compelling narrative of serious thinkers at work. There is much to learn in this book, which is truly a joy to read. He makes judgments, but they are aids, not substitutes, for our own thinking about liberalism as an idea and about its present possibilities."<b>--Thomas Bender, New York University</b></p><p>"<i>Liberalism: The Life of an Idea</i> possesses both the authority made possible by sustained scholarly research, and the clarity and simplicity found in first-rate journalism.

It is a very timely reminder of the achievements and problems of a political tradition now everywhere under siege."<b>--Gareth Stedman Jones, University of Cambridge and Queen Mary, University of London</b></p><p>"[A] fine work of intellectual history that shows, among much else, that experience can shape ideas, too."<b>--William Anthony Hay</b></p><p>"Elegant, fluently written, and wryly amusing, this enlightening history of liberalism tells a persuasive story of ideas and politics through the lives of a huge variety of characters. The result is tremendously enjoyable."<b>--Duncan Kelly, author of <i>The Propriety of Liberty</i></b></p><p>"This is, quite simply, one of the most lively and engaging books that I've read in some time. With a brisk narrative that holds the reader's attention from start to finish, <i>Liberalism</i> provides a comprehensive survey of the subject, introducing a remarkable diversity of people and ideas, and offering a creative reconsideration of familiar tensions. It is impossible to imagine a reader who wouldn't learn much from it. I certainly did."<b>--Ryan Patrick Hanley, author of <i>Adam Smith and the Character of Virtue</i></b></p><p>"Not only a gripping piece of intellectual history, it also equips the reader to understand today's threats--and how they might be withstood....

You tremble and look pale. <br>Is not this something more than fantasy? <br>What think you on't? <br> <br>HORATIO Before my God, I might not this believe <br>Without the sensible and true avouch <br>Of mine own eyes. <br> <br>MARCELLUS Is it not like the king? <br> <br>HORATIO As thou art to thyself. <br>Such was the very armour he had on <br>When he th'ambitious Norway combated: <br>So frowned he once when, in an angry parle, <br>He smote the steel�d pole-axe on the ice. <br>'Tis strange. <br> <br>MARCELLUS Thus twice before, and just at this dead hour, <br>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. <br> <br>HORATIO In what particular thought to work I know not, <br>But in the gross and scope of my opinion, <br>This bodes some strange eruption to our state. <br> <br>MARCELLUS Good now, sit down and tell me, he that knows, <br>Why this same strict and most observant watch <br>So nightly toils the subject of the land, <br>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon <br>And foreign mart for implements of war: <br>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task <br>Does not divide the Sunday from the week: <br>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste <br>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: <br>Who is't that can inform me? <br> <br>HORATIO That can I, <br>At least, the whisper goes so: our last king, <br>Whose image even but now appeared to us, <br>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, <br>Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride, <br>Dared to the combat, in which our valiant Hamlet - <br>For so this side of our known world esteemed him - <br>Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact, <br>Well ratified by law and heraldry, <br>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands <br>Which he stood seized on to the conqueror: <br>Against the which, a moiety competent <br>Was gag�d by our king, which had returned <br>To the inheritance of Fortinbras, <br>Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant, <br>And carriage of the article designed, <br>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, <br>Of unimprov�d mettle hot and full, <br>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there <br>Sharked up a list of landless resolutes <br>For food and diet to some enterprise <br>That hath a stomach in't, which is no other - <br>And it doth well appear unto our state - <br>But to recover of us, by strong hand <br>And terms compulsative, those foresaid lands <br>So by his father lost: and this, I take it, <br>Is the main motive of our preparations, <br>The source of this our watch and the chief head <br>Of this post-haste and rummage in the land. <br> <br> <i>Enter Ghost again</i> <br> <br>But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again! <br>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! <br>If thou hast any sound or use of voice, <br>Speak to me: <br>If there be any good thing to be done <br>That may to thee do ease and grace to me, <br>Speak to me: <br>If thou art privy to thy country's fate - <br>Which, haply, foreknowing may avoid - O, speak! <br>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life <br>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth - [ <i>A cock crows]</i> <br>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death - <br>Speak of it: stay and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus. <br> <br>MARCELLUS Shall I strike at it with my partisan? <br> <br>HORATIO Do, if it will not stand. They attempt to strike it <br> <br>BARNARDO 'Tis here! <br> <br>HORATIO 'Tis here! <br> <br>MARCELLUS 'Tis gone! <i>Exit Ghost</i> <br>We do it wrong, being so majestical, <br>To offer it the show of violence, <br>For it is as the air invulnerable, <br>And our vain blows malicious mockery. <br> <br>BARNARDO It was about to speak when the cock crew. <br> <br>HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing <br>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard <br>The cock, that is the trumpet to the day, <br>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat <br>Awake the god of day, and at his warning, <br>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, <br>Th'extravagant and erring spirit hies <br>To his confine: and of the truth herein <br>This present object made probation. <br> <br>MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock. <br>Some say that ever gainst that season comes <br>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, <br>The bird of dawning singeth all night long, <br>And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad: <br>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, <br>No fairy talks, nor witch hath power to charm, <br>So hallowed and so gracious is the time. <br> <br>HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it. <br>But, look, the morn in russet mantle clad, <br>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill. <br>Break we our watch up, and by my advice, <br>Let us impart what we have seen tonight <br>Unto young Hamlet, for upon my life, <br>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. <br>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, <br>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? <br> <br>MARCELLUS Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know <br>Where we shall find him most conveniently. <i>Exeunt</i> <br> <br> <b><br>Act 1 Scene 2</b> <i>running scene 2</i> <br> <i><br>Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,<br>Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant</i> <br> <br>KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death <br>The memory be green, and that it us befitted <br>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom <br>To be contracted in one brow of woe, <br>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature <br>That we with wisest sorrow think on him <br>Together with remembrance of ourselves. <br>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, <br>Th'imperial jointress of this warlike state, <br>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, <br>With one auspicious and one dropping eye, <br>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, <br>In equal scale weighing delight and dole, <br>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barred <br>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone <br>With this affair along. For all, our thanks. <br>Now follows that you know young Fortinbras, <br>Holding a weak supposal of our worth, <br>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death <br>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, <br>Colleagu�d with the dream of his advantage, <br>He hath not failed to pester us with message <br>Importing the surrender of those lands <br>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, <br>To our most valiant brother. So much for him. <br> <br> <i>Enter Voltemand and Cornelius</i> <br> <br>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting, <br>Thus much the business is: we have here writ <br>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras - <br>Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears <br>Of this his nephew's purpose - to suppress <br>His further gait herein, in that the levies, <br>The lists and full proportions, are all made <br>Out of his subject. And we here dispatch <br>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, <br>For bearing of this greeting to old Norway, <br>Giving to you no further personal power <br>To business with the king, more than the scope <br>Of these dilated articles allow. <i>[Gives a paper]</i> <br>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. <br> <br>VOLTEMAND In that, and all things, will we show our duty. <br> <br>KING We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.- <br> <br> <i>Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius</i> <br> <br>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? <br>You told us of some suit: what is't, Laertes? <br>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane <br>And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, <br>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? <br>The head is not more native to the heart, <br>The hand more instrumental to the mouth, <br>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. <br>What wouldst thou have, Laertes? <br> <br>LAERTES Dread my lord, <br>Your leave and favour to return to France, <br>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark <br>To show my duty in your coronation, <br>Yet now I must confess, that duty done, <br>My thoughts and wishes bend again towards France <br>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. <br> <br>KING Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? <br> <br>POLONIUS He hath, my lord: <br>I do beseech you, give him leave to go. <br> <br>KING Take thy fair hour, Laertes: time be thine, <br>And thy best graces spend it at thy will.- <br>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son- <br> <br>HAMLET A little more than kin and less than kind. <br> <br>KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you? <br> <br>HAMLET Not so, my lord:- I am too much i'th'sun. [ <i>Aside?</i>] <br> <br>GERTRUDE Good Hamlet, cast thy nightly colour off, <br>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. <br>Do not forever with thy veil�d lids <br>Seek for thy noble father in the dust: <br>Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die, <br>Passing through nature to eternity. <br> <br>HAMLET Ay, madam, it is common. <br> <br>GERTRUDE If it be, <br>Why seems it so particular with thee? <br> <br>HAMLET 'Seems', madam? Nay it is: I know not 'seems'. <br>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, <br>Nor customary suits of solemn black, <br>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, <br>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, <br>Nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage, <br>Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief, <br>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, <br>For they are actions that a man might play, <br>But I have that within which passeth show; <br>These but the trappings and the suits of woe. <br>KING 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, <br>To give these mourning duties to your father: <br>But you must know your father lost a father, <br>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound <br>In filial obligation for some term <br>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever <br>In obstinate condolement is a course <br>Of impious stubbornness: 'tis unmanly grief: <br>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, <br>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, <br>An understanding simple and unschooled. <br>For what we know must be and is as common <br>As any the most vulgar thing to sense, <br>Why should we in our peevish opposition <br>Take it to heart? Fie, 'tis a fault to heaven, <br>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, <br>To reason most absurd, whose common theme <br>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, <br>From the first corpse till he that died today, <br>'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth <br>This unprevailing woe, and think of us <br>As of a father; for let the world take note, <br>You are the most immediate to our throne, <br>And with no less nobility of love <br>Than that which dearest father bears his son, <br>Do I impart towards you. For your intent <br>In going back to school in Wittenberg, <br>It is most retrograde to our desire, <br>And we beseech you bend you to remain <br>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, <br>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. <br> <br>GERTRUDE Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: <br>I prithee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. <br> <br>HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you, madam. <br> <br>KING Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. <br>Be as ourself in Denmark.- Madam, come: <br>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet <br>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof, <br>No jocund health that Denmark drinks today <br>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, <br>And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again, <br>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. <br> <br> <i>Exeunt.

O God, O God! <br>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable <br>Seem to me all the uses of this world! <br>Fie on't! O, fie, fie!

Analyzing crime policies as they relate to crime rates and U.S. society's ability to both lower the crime rate and address the role of incarceration in preventing future crime, the book shows students how ineffective our rush to incarcerate has been in the last decade, as well as offering recommendations and insights into the future of this problem. Written in an informal and accessible style, Addicted to Incarceration is appropriate for criminal justice policy or corrections courses at the undergraduate level and can also be used as a supplementary text in introductory criminal justice, criminology, and critical issues in criminal justice courses.</p><p><p><b>Travis C.

Finally, the true story of America&#39;s first Black movie star is revealed in this brilliant, in-depth biography-from her turbulent childhood in Cleveland, to her Hollywood girlhood, her battles against racism, her rise to fame, her marriage and affairs, and her professional and personal decline. The first Black woman nominated for an Academy Award Dorothy Dandridge paved the way for thousands of Black women entertainers. She toured the South with &#34;The Dandridge Sisters,&#34; appeared in dozens of movies and on Broadway, played the Cotton Club, and worked with such luminaries as Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, and Maxine Sullivan. But Dandridge&#39;s stardom only seemed to exacerbate her deep-seated insecurities-shadowing her success until she died of an overdose at the age of 42. Filled with photographs, and rich with research as well as personal anecdotes from Harry Belafonte, Etta James and others, Dorothy Dandridge: A Biography is not only a fascinating study of the woman and the performer, but also a riveting look at Black Hollywood as it existed within the larger culture.</p><p>Donald Bogle was almost single-handedly responsible for reviving interest in historic black film with his seminal work, <i>Toms, Coons, Mammies, Mulattoes, and Bucks.</i> Here, in his new biography, he turns his gaze on Dorothy Dandrige, a bronze goddess of the silver screen. Stunningly beautiful and enormously talented, Dandridge had the misfortune to practice her craft at a time when Hollywood trafficked only in black stereotypes. She starred in several films--among them <i>Carmen Jones,</i> an adaptation of Bizet's <i>Carmen,</i> and the musical <i>Porgy and Bess.</i> But because there were few black male romantic leads, and Hollywood could not conceive of pairing her with a white actor, Dandridge's career languished. In 1965, she was found dead in her apartment of a drug overdose. Bogle's excellent book brings Dandrige and her times to life again, portraying this remarkable woman in all her strength and fragility.<p>Donald Bogle is one of the country's leading authorities on African Americans in Hollywood. He is the author of the groundbreaking <em>Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Films</em>; the acclaimed biography <em>Dorothy Dandridge</em>; and <em>Brown Sugar: Over 100 Years of America's Black Female Superstars</em>.

While these trends are largely attributed to technological change and demographic shifts, such as changing birth rates, labor force patterns, and immigration, public policies have also exerted a profound affect on the welfare of Americans. In Public Policy and the Income Distribution, editors Alan Auerbach, David Card, and John Quigley assemble a distinguished roster of policy analysts to confront the key questions about the role of government policy in altering the level and distribution of economic well being. Public Policy and the Income Distribution tackles many of the most difficult and intriguing questions about how government intervention&#x2015;or lack thereof&#x2015;has affected the incomes of everyday Americans. Rebecca Blank analyzes welfare reform, and presents systematic research on income, poverty rates, and welfare and labor force participation of single mothers. She finds that single mothers worked more and were less dependent on public assistance following welfare reform, and that low-skilled single mothers had no greater difficulty finding work than others. Timothy Smeeding compares poverty reduction programs in the United States with policies in other developed countries. Poverty and inequality are higher in the United States than in other advanced economies, but Smeeding argues that this is largely a result of policy choices. Poverty rates based on market incomes alone are actually lower in the United States than elsewhere, but government interventions in the United States were less than half as effective at reducing poverty as were programs in the other countries. The most dramatic poverty reduction story of twentieth century America was seen among the elderly, who went from being the age group most likely to live in poverty in the 1960s to the group least likely to be poor at the end of the century. Gary Englehardt and Jonathan Gruber examine the role of policy in alleviating old-age poverty by estimating the impact of Social Security benefits on the income of the elderly poor. They find that the growth in Social Security almost completely explains the large decline in elderly poverty in the United States The twentieth century was remarkable in the extent to which advances in public policy helped improve the economic well being of Americans. Synthesizing existing knowledge on the effectiveness of public policy and contributing valuable new research, Public Policy and the Income Distribution examines public policy's successes, and points out the areas in which progress remains to be made.</p><p>ALAN AUERBACH is Robert D.

They weren't the opulent, bejeweled harems of Scherezade, but the domestic sprawl of extended families encamped around a walled courtyard that marked the edges of women's lives. Though born into this tightly sheltered world, Fatimi Mernissi is constantly urged by her rebellious mother to spring beyond it. Worried that Mernissi is too shy and quiet, her mother tells her, "You must learn to scream and protest, just the way you learned to walk and talk." In <i>Dreams of Trespass</i>, an enjoyable weave of memory and fantasy, it is clear that Mernissi's fertile imagination let her slip back and forth through the gates that trapped her restive mother. She spins amiable, often improbable tales of the rigidly proper city harem in Fez and the contrasting freedoms of the country harem where her grandmother Yakima lives. There, one of Yakima's cowives rides like the wind, another swims like a fish, and Yakima relishes twitting the humorless first wife by naming a fat, waddling duck after her.<b>Fatema Mernissi</b> teaches sociology at University Mohammed V in Rabat, Morocco.

Hambourg, an assistant curator in the museum's Department of Photography, edited this big book with the straightforward approach that Evans employed in his art. Careful reproduction of well-known black-and-white and little-known color photographs by Evans forms the heart of the volume. There are quality essays here as well, biographical and analytical writing that effectively places Evans's visual efforts in social and territorial context. From the self-portrait on the cover to the notebook entries to the many photographs clustered along the way, Unclassified: A Walker Evans Anthology quickly broadens the popular view of the photographer as a chronicler of 1930s America with black-and-white film in his camera. Gathered from many files in the large and varied Evans Archive at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, these collected writings, photos, and ephemera give us a socially concerned writer, artist, and meticulous keeper of his life's work along with his opinions and his collections of postcards. This version of Evans shakes him free of any narrow channel in which we placed him. He led a robust life, and the stillness that comes from his Depression-era work is shaken up by this energized look at the photographer. Walker Evans pointed a camera at his world and let the documentary result speak as his art. Chief curator in the Museum of Modern Art's Department of Photography, Galassi has taken that objective eye as his theme. Gathering over 300 works from several media by 100 artists, Galassi gives us a volume of reportorial art, showing people, places, and things in "as is" condition. Evans touched people with his photographs because he merged his images with their "real lives." The question of whether other artists using other means were influenced by Evans's work or simply liberated to offer a visual vernacular landscape is incidental here. Galassi's book succeeds because his choices match his theme so well and play off the many examples of Evans's work that unite these pages. Though the Metropolitan catalog is the first choice for purchase, all three books are well recommended for all types of libraries and essential for serious art collections.DDavid Bryant, New Canaan Lib., CT <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All the King&#39;s Men (Cliffs Notes)</h2><p>One of the finest American novels ever written, All the King&#39;s Men is at its most basic the story of two men involved in the public and private swirls of political life.

The discussion of the magazine and its advertising&#x2019;s impact on the ideas of teenagers and young women about beauty and fashion is both perceptive and highly alarming.&#x201d;<p>- Arthur Asa Berger, Emeritus, San Francisco State University</p><br><br>&#x201c;Kelley Massoni has been indefatigable in seeking out information about Seventeen's creators and the details of their struggle to create a magazine that would address girls and workers and citizens as well as consumers. Her telling of that story is irresistible -- infused with energy and sparkling with insights about how the gender, class and race politics of the times get played out from the workplace to the market place to the pages of the magazine itself. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in gender and popular culture. More than that, it will entertain and enlighten anyone who used Seventeen as a model for how to be a real teenager.&#x201d;<p>- Joey Sprague, University of Kansas</p><br><br>&#x201c;Kelley Massoni has produced a masterful work ---a critical but fair review of all that brought Seventeen to life and above all the clarity of its creators' editorial commitment. I was overwhelmed by her interpretation of corporate machinations, as well as by her understanding of the role I played in what the new generation calls &#x2018;branding.&#x2019; Fashioning Teenagers is a fascinating story and a timely one."<p>- Estelle Ellis, Former Promotion Director, Seventeen Magazine</p><br><br><p>"Sociologist Massoni (Univ. of Kansas) offers the first book-length study of the most important teen magazine ever.&nbsp; It covers mostly the early years, from the founding of Seventeen in 1944 to the forced resignation of its first editor, Helen Valentine, in early 1950, and much of the book takes the form of a detailed comparison of the magazine&#x2019;s content in 1944/45 and 1949/50....&nbsp; The cultural and social history that underlies the book &#x2013; e.g. the postwar resurgence of the ideal of domesticity &#x2013; is well known.&nbsp; Massoni&#x2019;s major themes, including youth consumerism and the construction of the female body by advertisers ... will interest students of youth culture, consumerism, advertising, and postwar gender roles.&nbsp; Summing up: Recommended.&nbsp; Upper-division undergraduates and above."<br><br>-- CHOICE&nbsp;(W. Graebner, emeritus, SUNY Fredonia)</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Kelley Massoni offers insight into the first six years of what was meant to be a service and fashion magazine for teenagers growing up in the throes of a war-driven economy. Since then, Massoni argues, Seventeen has come to represent a culture in which teens are not only 'consumers but also the consumed.'... the book offers a cultural narrative that transcends time and is a useful resource for both scholarly and classroom purposes.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Miglena Sternadori, Journal of Magazine &amp; New Media Research</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s interesting about Massoni&#x2019;s approach is that she simultaneously traces the magazine&#x2019;s history while describing the behind-the-scenes internal politics that took place at Seventeen.... Fashioning Teenagers: A Cultural History of Seventeen Magazine is likely to appeal to those interested in magazine history, as this particular magazine led the charge in the creation of the host of teen-oriented publications that followed. It also may appeal to those interested in learning more about advertising, marketing, and promotion, as it shows how creative advertising and promotional techniques can really make a difference in influencing consumer trends.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Andi Stein, The Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication</p><br><br>&#x201c;Through careful analysis of archival data and biographical interviews with former staffers, Massoni traces the development of Seventeen and illustrates how the magazine&#x2019;s content reflected the contradictions of the progressive age.... Massoni documents how the content in Seventeen increasingly complemented the advertiser&#x2019;s ideal image of the teen girl consumer. A look at the modern pages of Seventeen shows quite clearly the staying power of such a symbiotic relationship. Massoni provides important insight into how consumerism shaped the image of the modern teenager and reveals the alternative path that might have been possible. The book will be of interest to those interested in consumer culture, gender, and media studies, and could be used to supplement undergraduate instruction on the social construction of the lifecourse.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Contemporary Sociology</p><h2>Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2015 International Building Code, 5th Edition</h2><p><b>Dive into the history and application of the IBC</b><p><i>Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to the 2015 International Building Code, Fifth Edition</i> is a bestselling complement to the International Building Code, or IBC.

Thunder Run is the story of the surprise assault on Baghdad-one of the most decisive battle in American combat history-by the Spartan Brigade, the Second Brigade of the Third Infantry Division (Mechanized).<br>More than just a rendering of a single battle, Thunder Run is a candid account of how soldiers respond under fire and stress and how human frailties are magnified in a war zone.</p><p>When asked to describe a battle as seen through the camera of an unmanned aerial vehicle, one Army brigade commander said it was like watching a football game through a straw.<p> The same metaphor could be used to describe the pictures and stories relayed by embedded reporters in Iraq. This innovative program took civilian reporters and attached them to combat units on the ground and at sea. The downside was that these journalists often saw little more than their unit's piece of the battlefield. Fortunately, this cannot be said of David Zucchino's Thunder Run, which chronicles the armored assaults on Baghdad by the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division. Zucchino paints a vivid picture of the battle by stitching together the narratives of soldiers, officers, generals and Iraqis whom he interviewed during and after the war. As a result, his book goes far beyond the "first draft of history" that he filed from Baghdad in April 2003.</p><p> Zucchino wasn't meant to cover the Spartan Brigade or its thunder runs. He was originally embedded with the 101st Airborne Division, a light infantry force that was supposed to get the mission to assault Baghdad. But in the fog of war, both things changed. Zucchino and his equipment were dumped into a canal by a vehicle accident, and he decided to hitch a ride with the 3rd Infantry Division instead of the 101st. As it turned out, his instincts paid off, and he accidentally found himself with a ringside seat for the war's pivotal battle.</p><p> The Spartan Brigade's mission was to slice through Baghdad to the heart of the Hussein regime in order to break the Iraqi army and the Iraqi people's will to fight. Conventional wisdom held that it was unwise to send armored forces into urban areas and, indeed, given the recent U.S. experience in Somalia, that it was unwise to fight in cities at all. However, American planners were convinced that an armored force could smash through Baghdad's defenses without getting bogged down in house-to-house fighting.</p><p> More important, though, the mission was designed to win the information war in Iraq. The presence of American tanks in Baghdad would give the lie to propaganda that said Iraqi soldiers were killing American soldiers in droves and winning the war. Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, the beret-wearing Iraqi minister of information known as "Baghdad Bob," particularly irked officers in the 3rd Infantry Division with his claims that U.S. forces were committing "suicide at the gates of Baghdad." The best way to prove him wrong, joked Spartan Brigade commander Col. David Perkins, was to "ask for validation for parking for a hundred tanks" in the middle of Baghdad. As Zucchino shows, not everything went right for the brigade during its two assaults on Baghdad. A tank caught fire a few miles into the first thunder run, slowing the column and jeopardizing the entire mission. One tank mistook a journalist with binoculars for an artillery spotter and killed two reporters with a deadly accurate shot to the Palestine Hotel during the second thunder run. The Iraqis' low-tech weapons pounded the Americans' high-tech tanks and Bradley armored vehicles on both missions and exacted a heavy price from support vehicles brought up to refuel and rearm the Spartan Brigade. Iraqi fighters also came close to severing the brigade's line of communication during one of the war's toughest battles, for three highway interchanges known as Objectives Moe, Larry and Curly.</p><p> Most of Thunder Run's narrative focuses on the captains, lieutenants and sergeants who led the fight -- men (only men fought in the brigade's three combat battalions) mostly in their late twenties and their thirties who had all served in the post-Vietnam Army, grown up on stories from the Gulf War, and come of age in that conflict or the brushfire deployments of the 1990s. An after-action review credited these officers and their training with producing a "seasoned fighting force that was trained and ready to fight and win on any battlefield."</p><p> As an embedded reporter, Zucchino spent enough time with the troops he covered to understand the complex social dynamics that define warriors under fire. "They were fighting for their country, of course, and for the inherent nobility of their profession," he writes. "But mostly, they were fighting to come home alive and to ensure that the men beside them came home, too. . . . A few men spoke of 'getting some,' that peculiar, sexually tinged reference to confronting the enemy and killing him. But most of them spoke of getting out of Iraq alive, and their buddies with them."</p><p>Reviewed by Phillip Carter<br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p>Even a very short, victorious shooting war against a disorganized, dispirited, vastly outnumbered and underequipped enemy is hell. That is the central message that <i>Los Angeles Times</i> correspondent Zucchino brings home startlingly well in this riveting account of the American military's lightning capture of Baghdad in April 2003. Zucchino (<i>The Myth of the Welfare Queen</i>) is an experienced, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning reporter, and he shows off his reportorial skills in this reconstruction of the "lightning armored strike" in Iraq that the military refers to as a "thunder run." The narrative focuses on the men who commanded and battled in the tank battles as the Americans fought their way to Iraq's capital city. It is often not a pretty picture, nor one for the faint of heart, because Zucchino unhesitatingly and graphically describes the violent and grisly fates that befell hundreds, if not thousands, of Iraqi Republican Guard troops and fedayeen militiamen, their Syrian allies (at the border) and the unfortunate civilians who were killed or wounded by the deadly high-tech American armored vehicles and their well-trained crews. He also does not shy away from intimately describing the deaths and injuries of American troops. The Americans who fought their way into Baghdad engaged in, according to Zucchino's account, a vicious, if short-lived, war. While the Americans overwhelmed the Iraqis on the road to Baghdad, U.S. troops faced periodic stiff resistance; rocket-propelled grenades caused death and destruction among the crews in the Bradley fighting vehicles. Zucchino tells his story primarily from the American troops' point of view, but does include a section describing the experiences of a Baath Party militia leader and some Republican Guard officers in this high-quality example of in-depth and evocative war reporting.

At the age of sixteen he became an apprentice architect but continued to develop his classical education by studying between the hours of four and eight each morning. With encouragement from Horace Moule of Queens' College Cambridge, he began to write fiction. His first published novel was <i>Desperate Remedies</i> in 1871. Thus began a series of increasingly dark novels, all set within the rural landscape of his native Dorset. Such was the success of these early works, which included<i> A Pair of Blue Eyes</i> (1873) and <i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i> (1874), that he gave up his work as an architect to concentrate on his writing. However, he had difficulty publishing<i> </i><i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i> (1889) and was forced to make changes in order for it to be judged suitable for family readers. This, coupled with the stormy reaction to the negative tone of<i> </i><i>Jude the Obscure</i><i> </i>(1895), prompted Hardy to abandon writing novels altogether and he concentrated on poetry for the rest of his life. He died in January 1928.</p><h2>L&#39;Emp�docle de Strasbourg (P. Strasb. gr.

For classical architects, the term Palladian stands for a vocabulary of architectural forms embodying perfection and beauty. Of even greater significance than Palladio's buildings is his treatise <i>I quattro libri dell'architettura</i> (The Four Books On Architecture), the most successful architectural treatise of the Renaissance and one of the two or three most important books in the literature of architecture. First published in Italian in 1570, it has been translated into every major Western language.</p><p>This is the first English translation of Palladio in over 250 years, making it the only translation available in modern English. Until now, English-language readers have had to rely mostly on a facsimile of Isaac Ware's 1738 translation and the eighteenth-century engravings prepared for that text. This new translation by Robert Tavernor and Richard Schofield contains Palladio's original woodcuts, reproduced in facsimile and positioned correctly, adjacent to the text. The book also contains a glossary that explains technical terms in their original context, a bibliography of recent Palladio research, and an introduction to Palladio and his times.</p><p>The First Book discusses building materials and techniques, as well as the five orders of architecture: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. Palladio describes the characteristics of each order and illustrates them. The Second Book discusses private town houses and country estates, almost all designed by Palladio. The Third Book discusses streets, bridges, piazzas, and basilicas, most of ancient Roman origin. The Fourth Book discusses ancient Roman temples, including the Pantheon.</p></p><p>Richard Schofield is Professor of Architectural History at the Instituto universitario di architettura at Venice (IUAV).

His major works include, with Felix Guattari, <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i> and <i>Anti-Oedipus</i>.&#34;Cinema I and Cinema II must be understood as works of philosophy, not of film criticism. They are Deleuze&#39;s reflection on the new ways the cinema enables us to think about time and movement, opening up insights into semiotics and our ideological construction of a world increasingly experienced through representational media.... The main purpose of these books is to identify and explore the implications of a vital shift from classical, pre-World War II cinema of the movement-image to post-World War II cinema of the time-imaging.... &#34;Cinema 1 and Cinema 2 perhaps ultimately have more to teach us about philosophy, conceptions of subjectivity, and hermeneutics than to say something about any specific film. These books are challenging because they develop their own vocabulary in dialogue with the history of philosophy, and they assume a wide knowledge of films from the Soviet, European and Hollywood traditions. They reward the effort required to read them, however, for the original tools with which they provide us to understand cinema and semiotics more generally. Deleuze concludes that it is important to think of cinema not as a language, but as a way of bringing to light &#39;intelligible content&#39; which is a condition through which language constructs its objects (Cinema 2, p.251). Thus, purely optical and sound images which do not extend into action might be one way in which aesthetics might help us break outside of the determining structure of linguistic systems, enabling us to imagine the world otherwise. Deleuze helps us to see cinema as more than just a collection of texts but as additionally &#39;a new practice of images and signs, whose theory philosophy must produce as conceptual practice&#39; (Cinema 2, p. 269).&#34;- Sherryl Vint, Film International, Issue 27v -- Film International</p><h2>Holt Science &amp; Technology: Microorganisms, Fungi, and Plants Course A (Holt Science &amp; Technology [Short Course])</h2><p>Great book for schools and home schools!</p><p></p><h2>1984</h2><p>George Orwell&#39;s classic novel serves as a warning to future generations of the evils that arise from a life under constant surveillance by an all-knowing government. Orwell paints a bleak picture of oppression by a hierarchical system of control. 1984, with its intense use of detail, creates an image in the reader&#39;s mind of destruction; the destruction of the free will of the individual person.</p><p>"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere."<p> The year is 1984; the scene is London, largest population center of Airstrip One.</p><p> Airstrip One is part of the vast political entity Oceania, which is eternally at war with one of two other vast entities, Eurasia and Eastasia. At any moment, depending upon current alignments, all existing records show either that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or that it has always been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant "correction" of such records. "'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'"</p><p> In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.</p><p> <i>Newspeak</i>, <i>doublethink</i>, <i>thoughtcrime</i>--in <i>1984</i>, George Orwell created a whole vocabulary of words concerning totalitarian control that have since passed into our common vocabulary. More importantly, he has portrayed a chillingly credible dystopia. In our deeply anxious world, the seeds of unthinking conformity are everywhere in evidence; and Big Brother is always looking for his chance. <i>--Daniel Hintzsche</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Trouble With Black Boys: ...And Other Reflections on Race, Equity, and the Future of Public Education</h2><p>For many years to come, race will continue to be a source of controversy and conflict in American society. For many of us it will continue to shape where we live, pray, go to school, and socialize. We cannot simply wish away the existence of race or racism, but we can take steps to lessen the ways in which the categories trap and confine us. Educators, who should be committed to helping young people realize their intellectual potential as they make their way toward adulthood, have a responsibility to help them find ways to expand identities related to race so that they can experience the fullest possibility of all that they may become. In this brutally honest&#x2014;yet ultimately hopeful&#x2014; book Pedro Noguera examines the many facets of race in schools and society and reveals what it will take to improve outcomes for all students.

Leland's original quest was to make contact with practicing Italian Witches. After years of trying he met one by the name of Maddelena, who transmitted to him the teachings he was searching for. The words (stories) have become <i>The Aradia or the Gospel of the Witches</i>. This manuscript, reportedly handed down in an oral tradition, was later translated and published in the late 1800's.</p><p>Today, a great amount of debate exists over whether or not Aradia was an authentic representation of Italian Witchcraft at the time Leland published the manuscript. Some go so far as to argue that Maddelena never really existed. While it is true that Maddelena's involvement with Leland can not be proven the fact remains that even with an uncertain origin, Aradia is one of the most important manuscripts available to the Pagan community. Even if it does not reflect the ideology of a hidden tradition of Italian Witchcraft, it most definitely presents such a powerful message that even today its words are found repeatedly in various literature. In fact, it is the foundation for one of the most powerful and well-known documents in modern Pagan lore, <i>The Charge of the Goddess</i>.</p></p><p>Witchcraft is known to its votaries as <i>la vecchia religione</i>, or the old religion, of which Diana is the Goddess, her daughter Aradia (or Herodias) the female Messiah, and that this little work sets forth how the latter was born, came down to earth, established witches and witchcraft, and then returned to heaven. With it are given the ceremonies and invocations or incantations to be addressed to Diana and Aradia, the exorcism of Cain, and the spells of the holy-stone, rue, and verbena, constituting, as the text declares, the regular church-service, so to speak, which is to be chanted or pronounced at the witch-meetings. There are also included the very curious incantations or benedictions of the honey, meal, and salt, or cakes of the witch-supper, which is curiously classical, and evidently a relic of the Roman Mysteries... [From the Introduction]Charles G. Leland (August 15, 1824 &#x2013; March 20, 1903) was an American humorist and folklorist. He became interested in folklore and folk linguistics, publishing books and articles on American and European languages and folk traditions. He studied languages, wrote poetry, and pursued a variety of other interests, including hermeticism, Neo-Platonism, and the writings of Rabelais and Villon. After college, he went to Europe to continue his studies. In his travels, he made a study of the Gypsies, on whom he wrote more than one book. He began to publish a number of books on ethnography, folklore and language. His writings on Algonquian and gypsy culture were part of the contemporary interest in pagan and Aryan traditions. He erroneously claimed to have discovered 'the fifth Celtic tongue': the form of Cant, spoken among Irish Travellers, which he named Shelta. He became president of the English Gypsy-Lore Society in 1888. He wrote Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, reportedly containing the traditional beliefs of Italian witchcraft as conveyed him in a manuscript provided by a woman named Maddalena, whom he refers to as his "witch informant." This remains his most influential book.</p><h2>Civil Law and Litigation for Paralegals (Aspen College)</h2><p><p>Civil Law and Litigation for Paralegals is a comprehensive text designed specifically for paralegal civil litigation courses.

Until now, no one has offered a perspective of what daily life was actually like throughout the entire region devastated by this crisis, nor has anyone probed far into its causes. Here, the distinguished historian William Jordan provides the first comprehensive inquiry into the Famine from Ireland to western Poland, from Scandinavia to central France and western Germany. He produces a rich cultural history of medieval community life, drawing his evidence from such sources as meteorological and agricultural records, accounts kept by monasteries providing for the needy, and documentation of military campaigns. Whereas there has been a tendency to describe the food shortages as a result of simply bad weather or else poor economic planning, Jordan sets the stage so that we see the complex interplay of social and environmental factors that caused this particular disaster and allowed it to continue for so long.</p><br><p> Jordan begins with a description of medieval northern Europe at its demographic peak around 1300, by which time the region had achieved a sophisticated level of economic integration. He then looks at problems that, when combined with years of inundating rains and brutal winters, gnawed away at economic stability. From animal diseases and harvest failures to volatile prices, class antagonism, and distribution breakdowns brought on by constant war, northern Europeans felt helplessly besieged by acts of an angry God--although a cessation of war and a more equitable distribution of resources might have lessened the severity of the food shortages.</p><br><p> Throughout Jordan interweaves vivid historical detail with a sharp analysis of why certain responses to the famine failed. He ultimately shows that while the northern European economy did recover quickly, the Great Famine ushered in a period of social instability that had serious repercussions for generations to come.</p></p><p>The early 1300s must have seemed like the end of the world to the unfortunate inhabitants of Europe: brutally severe winters gave way to lightning storms and torrential, crop-destroying rains in spring, followed by cold summers and then bitter winters again. &#34;The whole world was troubled,&#34; wrote one Austrian chronicler; yet that was only the beginning. Princeton University historian William Chester Jordan reconstructs the terrible decades when climatological change led to famine, disease, rampant inflation, and social breakdown across the European continent, a time when every prayer for relief was met by even crueler turns of fate.<p>"Pestilence and War have had their historians. Famine now has its own with this brilliantly written masterpiece of historical anthropology."<b>--<i>Jacques Le Goff</i></b></p><p>"Superb detective work, as all good historical research should be, it is well organized, fast moving, and above all else, persuasive. Jordan spins a horrifying tale, dealing, in turn, with the nature of the calamity and how it affected the nobility, peasants, and townfolk--starvation, disease, displacement, and death.... Yes, this is true scholarship, but also a riveting tale as well."<b>--<i>The Virginia Quarterly Review</i></b></p></p><h2>Daily Life in Ancient Rome</h2><p>This book, now available in paperback, concerns the everyday private and public lives of the citizens of ancient Rome. Drawing on a broad selection of contemporary sources, the author examines the institutions, actions and rituals of day to day life.</p><p>This is a vivid and intimate account of everyday life in ancient Rome during the Republic, from the downfall of the kings in 509 BC to the seizure of power by Augustus in 27 BC. Drawing widely on rich contemporary sources, Florence Dupont recreates the public and private lives, rituals, actions, institutions, and religion of the Roman Republic. She shows how Roman culture and society revolved around one kind of individual, the Roman citizen, whose roles encompassed soldier, voter, estate-owner, householder and slave-master, <i>paterfamilias,</i> priest, party-goer, farmer and city-dweller. It was citizenship, she reveals, that shaped Roman notions of space, time, human nature and the human body. <p>The author describes the profound effect of Rome's increasing power and wealth. Excess, luxury and greed gradually eroded the traditional values of order, thrift, honor and liberty: citizens became transformed into subjects. 'Streets flowed with precious wines and the blood of exotic wild animals and inumerable oxen,' she writes. 'Makeshift theaters were thrown up and bedecked with gold and ivory. In a hopeless attempt to empty both its own coffers and those of the nobility, the republic endowed the city with temples, basilicas and colonnades. But the world was too rich, too vast, and Rome, at its center, choked on all its wealth.'</p><b>Florence Dupont</b> is Professor of Latin at the University of Nice. <p> <b>Christopher Woodall</b> is a freelance translator and journalist.</p></p><h2>Earth Construction: A comprehensive guide</h2><p>A comprehensive and illustrated handbook which will be essential reading for anyone involved in construction.

Problems with either of its dual roles of protection and exchange lie at the root of most thoracic disorders. Detailed descriptions and illustrations are provided of tests for dysfunction and treatment of the nonaxial joints, fasciae and viscera of this important area of the body. </p><p>Among the special topics contained in this volume are global and local listening of the thorax; utilization of the completed Adson-Wright test; cervical attachments of the pleura; intrasternal tests and treatment; utilization of various access points to the phrenic nerve; and stretching along the orientation of the coronary arteries. </p><p>The Thorax is an important book for all practitioners who wish to broaden their skills in visceral manipulation.</p></p><p>Ost?opathe DO, dipl?m? de l?&#34;European School of Ostheopathy&#34; (Maidstone, Royaume-Uni) et de la facult? de m?decine Paris-Nord (d?partement ost?opathie et m?decine manuelle)</p><h2>Look and Find Monsters University</h2><p>Monster University a Disney &#x2013; PIXAR Production is a children&#x2019;s hardcover book.

After a day or two of coverage in the newspapers, the report dropped from sight. The plan set out a system of parks and parkways, children's playgrounds, and public beaches. It is a model of ambitious, intelligent, sensitive planning commissioned at a time when land was available, if only the city planners had had the fortitude and vision to act on its recommendations. <br><br> "Parks, Playgrounds, and Beaches" has become a highly valued but difficult-to-find document. In this book, Greg Hise and William Deverell examine the reasons it was called for, analyze why it failed, and open a discussion about the future of urban public space. In addition to their introduction and a facsimile reproduction of the report, <i>Eden by Design</i> includes a dialogue between Hise, Deverell, and widely admired landscape architect Laurie Olin that illuminates the significance of the Olmsted-Bartholomew report and situates it in the history of American landscape planning.</p><p>"<i>Eden by Design</i> is a compelling and fascinating description of a possible Los Angeles that never came to be. Greg Hise and William Deverell have resurrected the Olmsted Brothers' 1930 plan for Los Angeles County, and then, in a wonderful introduction, put the plan in context so that to read it now is to see not only what seemed dangerous and possible in 1930 but also how and why one route to the present was chosen over others. In their hands, the plan acts like a ghost of Los Angeles, reminding us about a vanished past, lost possibilities, and the secrets that our present masks."&#x2015;Richard White, author of <i>The Organic Machine</i><br><br>"The Report is not only a vital document in the history of Los Angeles . . . but a lost classic of a neglected golden age of city planning and landscape architecture. . . .

So reads Noah's curse on his son Ham, and all his descendants, in Genesis 9:25. Over centuries of interpretation, Ham came to be identified as the ancestor of black Africans, and Noah's curse to be seen as biblical justification for American slavery and segregation. Examining the history of the American interpretation of Noah's curse, this book begins with an overview of the prior history of the reception of this scripture and then turns to the distinctive and creative ways in which the curse was appropriated by American pro-slavery and pro-segregation interpreters.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen R.

The dubious legend of Noah, as Stephen R. Haynes points out, is still with us, along with the Confederate symbols flying over public places and fundamentalists denouncing racial mixing. The Southern mind, he brilliantly explains, has woven the conventions of honor, the burdens of shame, the practice of race subordination, and the concept of divine grace into a single cultural fabric. In the field of religious and sectional history, this work will take an honored place next to the studies of Eugene Genovese and Donald Mathews. No one interested in American religious history can ignore this intellectually powerful study."--Bertram Wyatt-Brown, University of Florida; Author of <em>Southern Honor and The Shaping of Southern Culture</em><p></p><br>"The ancient rabbis suggested that every biblical text has seventy legitimate meanings (and no doubt an infinite number of illegitimate ones). Stephen Haynes has produced an amazing history of interpretation of the Ham and Nimrod narratives. It becomes clear through his careful research that such texts are supple and vulnerable to misguided theological passion. This book lets us reflect on old mistakes and, by inference, invites us to reflect on our own availability for parallel misreadings. <em>Noah's Curse</em> is an exercise in historical disclosure not to be missed by those who care about the crisis of reading in the church and in a Bible-rooted culture."--Walter Brueggemann, Professor of Old Testament, Columbia Theological Seminary; Author of <em>Spirituality of the Psalms</em>&gt;<p></p><br>"Haynes's study provides a thorough and rich sense of the interpretive history of the scriptural story"--<em>Christian Century</em><p></p><br></p><h2>How to Conduct Surveys: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>The <b>Fifth Edition</b> of Arlene Fink&#x2032;s best-selling <b>How to Conduct Surveys</b> guides readers through the process of developing their own rigorous surveys and evaluating the credibility of surveys created by others.

With the exception of the essay by Louis Gernet, all bear traces of the authors; attempts to combine older views stemming essentially from Durkheim and his pupils with Levi-Strauss&#39;s version of structuralism. Because the potential field is unmanageably large this selection concentrates on four important areas: the value of Greek myth in revealing the underlying coherence of Greek views of divinity; the manner in which Greek myth constructed meanings for Greek culture as a whole by selecting and combining certain motifs derived from different areas of life; the relationship between myth and delicate areas of social existence such as the nature of the value of certain objects and the passage of individuals from one status to another; and finally, the role of the myth in providing &#39;forms&#39; for breaking rules - both in order to confirm the norm and to provide symbolic and actuals means of escape from dominant social rules and meanings. This book should be of interest to students in a number of disciplines concerned with myth and ancient society.</p><p>The essays in this volume explore different aspects of the relation between Greek myth and Greek thought between the Archaic period (Homer and Hesiod) and the Hellenistic period, highlighting both the continuities and the contrasts in the Greek interpretations and &#39;uses&#39; of myth.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Forests of Lilliput; The Realm of Mosses and Lichens</h2><p>Sm Quarto, Pp.210, B &amp; W Photos, One Of The Few Books Written about these Plants In Non Technical Language,</p><p></p><h2>The Ancient Origins of Consciousness: How the Brain Created Experience (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>How consciousness appeared much earlier in evolutionary history than is commonly assumed, and why all vertebrates and perhaps even some invertebrates are conscious.</b></p><p>How is consciousness created? When did it first appear on Earth, and how did it evolve? What constitutes consciousness, and which animals can be said to be sentient? In this book, Todd Feinberg and Jon Mallatt draw on recent scientific findings to answer these questions&#x2015;and to tackle the most fundamental question about the nature of consciousness: how does the material brain create subjective experience? </p><p>After assembling a list of the biological and neurobiological features that seem responsible for consciousness, and considering the fossil record of evolution, Feinberg and Mallatt argue that consciousness appeared much earlier in evolutionary history than is commonly assumed. About 520 to 560 million years ago, they explain, the great &#x201c;Cambrian explosion&#x201d; of animal diversity produced the first complex brains, which were accompanied by the first appearance of consciousness; simple reflexive behaviors evolved into a unified inner world of subjective experiences. From this they deduce that all vertebrates are and have always been conscious&#x2015;not just humans and other mammals, but also every fish, reptile, amphibian, and bird. Considering invertebrates, they find that arthropods (including insects and probably crustaceans) and cephalopods (including the octopus) meet many of the criteria for consciousness. The obvious and conventional wisdom&#x2013;shattering implication is that consciousness evolved simultaneously but independently in the first vertebrates and possibly arthropods more than half a billion years ago. Combining evolutionary, neurobiological, and philosophical approaches allows Feinberg and Mallatt to offer an original solution to the &#x201c;hard problem&#x201d; of consciousness.</p></p><p>Todd E.

In addition, comments on these readings help students with interpretation and follow the flow of thought from one passage to another. Features include: * New design with four-color format and more photos and improved maps * Chapters begin with list, of study goals and end with summary, overview and of people, places, terms to remember, and review questions * Outlines, section headings, subheadings, and bolded items make it easy to follow structure of discussion * Phonetic pronunciations for unfamiliar names and terms * Breakouts with illustrative quotes from ancient, nonbiblical literature * Discussion questions on the contemporary relevance of the New Testament * Updated bibliographies * Conservative evangelical theological perspective also notes other positions and literature</p><p>Most surveys of the New Testament provide the student with background information and technical introductory material, but they do little to help the reader understand the text of the New Testament. A Survey of the New Testament, by contrast, is a guide to reading and interpreting the New Testament itself. General questions of introduction and background are still covered, but whenever possible in the context of assigned readings from the New Testament. In addition, comments on the assigned New Testament readings help the student interpret the text and understand the flow of thought from section to section. A major change in the third edition is that the harmonistic treatment of Jesus&#39; life has been shortened and the discussion of the individual gospels has been expanded. Additional features: - Each section begins with leading questions that help focus the student&#39;s reading - The theological perspective is evangelical and orthodox, but other positions are frequently noted, and suggestions for further reading include literature from different persuasions - Section headings and marginal headings make it easy to follow the structure of the text - Questions for further discussion help the student think through the contemporary relevance of the New Testament writings - Bibliographies have been updated - The book has a new, user-friendly design with many added illustrationsRobert H.

Jane Gay's <i>With the Nez Perc�s: Alice Fletcher in the Field, 1889&#x2013;92</i> (Nebraska 1981).&#34;This is an important book. In the latter nineteenth century, diverse and influential elements in white America combined forces to settle the &#39;Indian question&#39; through assimilation... The results were the essentially treaty-breaking Dawes Act of 1887, related legislation, and dubious court decisions. Schoolteachers and missionaries were dispatched to the reservations en masse. Eventual &#39;citizenship&#39; without functional rights was given Native Americans; the Indians lost two-thirds of reservation land as it had existed before the assimilationist campaign... With insight and skill that go well beyond craft, Hoxie has admirably defined issues and motives, placed economic/political/social interaction into cogent perspective, brought numerous Anglo and Indian individuals and organizations to life, and set forth important lessons.&#34;--Choice. &#34;Hoxie employs changing anthropological theory, the history of Indian education, and a considerable sampling of popular literature to place the problem firmly within the crucible of national political life... This significant study of Indian-white relations during a complex time in national politics deserves close attention.&#34;--American Indian Quarterly. &#34;Important and intellectually challenging... This volume goes far to fill a large gap in the history of United States Indian policy.&#34;--Journal of American History.</p><h2>Cartographies of Knowledge: Exploring Qualitative Epistemologies</h2><p><p><b>Mapping geographies of power and knowledge in qualitative research</b></p><p></p><p>"In this foundational tome, Professor Celine-Marie Pascale critiques methodology in relationship to specific qualitative methods and argues cogently that despite good intentions, most of this research is still tethered to the Cartesian paradigm thus limiting its emancipatory potential.

The editor, Vernon Richards, has translated hundreds of articles by Malatesta, taken from the journals Malatesta either edited himself or contributed to, from the earliest, <i>L&#x2019;En Dehors</i> of 1892, through to <i>Pensiero e Volont�</i>, which was forced to close by Mussolini&#x2019;s fascists in 1926, and the bilingual <i>Il Risveglio/Le R�veil</i>, which published most of his writings after that date. These articles have been pruned down to their essentials and collected under subheadings ranging from &#x201c;Ends and Means&#x201d; to &#x201c;Anarchist Propaganda.&#x201d; Through the selections Malatesta&#x2019;s classical anarchism emerges: a revolutionary, nonpacifist, nonreformist vision informed by decades of engagement in struggle and study. In addition there is a short biographical piece and an essay by the editor.<i></i></p></p><p><p><b>Errico Malatesta</b> was an Italian anarchist.

It has suffered the dubious distinction of being wiped off the political map in 1795, to be resurrected after the First World War, to suffer seeming annihilation during the Second World War, reduction to satellite status of the Soviet Union after 1945, only to emerge during the 1980s. It is presently a contender for membership in the European Union. The only general introduction to the politics of Polish history in English, The Concise History of Poland covers medieval times to the present. The authors describe how Polish society developed under foreign rule in the 19th century and how it was altered by and responded to 45 years of communism, and developments since its collapse. Primarily a political outline of Poland&#39;s turbulent and complex past, it traces the process of its rise and fall from the middle ages, from a dynastic realm to a remarkable constitutional experiment in multinational, consensual politics, embracing much of Lithuania, Ukraine, and Belarus. Jerzy Lukowski is Senior Lecturer in Modern History, School of Historical Studies, at the University of Birmingham, UK. He is also the author of, The Partitions of Poland (Addison Wesley, 1998), and Liberty&#39;s Folly (Routledge, 1991), and many journal articles.

Earlier he had worked in experimental biophysics at Tulane University and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Orleans under the direction of Robert Dixon McAfee, where Dr. McAfee's research team's primary focus was on the active transport of sodium ions by biological membranes. Penney's primary contribution here was the development of a mathematical model (using simultaneous ordinary differential equations) for the metabolic phenomena regulating such transport, with potential future applications in kidney physiology, management of hypertension, and treatment of congestive heart failure. He also designed and constructed servomechanisms for the accurate monitoring of ion transport, a phenomenon involving the measurement of potentials in microvolts at impedances of millions of megohms. Penney began teaching calculus at Tulane in 1957 and taught that course almost every term with enthusiasm and distinction until his retirement at the end of the last millennium. During his tenure at the University of Georgia he received numerous University-wide teaching awards as well as directing several doctoral dissertations and seven undergraduate research projects.

It addresses the gulf between the almost universally fashionable rhetoric of participation, promising empowerment and appropriate development. Looking at what actually happens when consultants and activists promote and practice participatory development, this book offers a sharp challenge to the advocates of participatory development. Some contributors look at particular examples of failed participatory practice; others present more conceptually-oriented analyses. Together they provide a new, rigorous, and provocative understanding of participatory development.<br></p><p><b>Uma Kothari</b> is a senior lecturer in development studies at the School of Environment and Development, University of Manchester. She is coeditor of <i>Participation: The New Tyranny</i>, from Zed Books, and <i>Development Theory and Practice: Critical Perspectives</i>.'A timely critique of the participation discourse and expose of the seductive arts of official incorporation. Essential reading for all those studying and practising international development as well as social policy nearer home.' - Geoff Wood, Professor of International Development and Director of the Institute for International Policy Analysis at the University of Bath<br><br>'This volume unmasks the moral tyranny imposed through the language of participation which has come to dominate the discourse of 'devspeak'. In exploring participatory practices from several points of view -- social psychology, sociology of management, Goffman's analysis of social performance, Foucauldian analysis of discourses and their power - it shows how radical and democratic language may be co-opted with the aim of bringing people's views and expectations into line with the plans devised, with their participation, by their betters. Makes a vital contribution to the sociology of development.' - Gavin Williams, University of Oxford <br></p><h2>The Collected Essays of Arthur Miller (Theatre Makers)</h2><p>This selection of Arthur Miller's essays draws together essays by one of the most influential literary, cultural and intellectual voices of our time. Arranged chronologically, these writings take the reader on a whirlwind tour of modern history: the Nazi war crimes trials, Vietnam, Watergate, the Balkan conflict and even President Clinton's infamous liaison with Monica Lewinsky. From his personal experience, Miller writes passionate discourses on censorship and the death penalty, and Swiftian satire on the McCarthy witch-hunts; records his meeting with Nelson Mandela, and assesses the lasting impact of the Depression on an American generation. <br><br> The essays are also a remarkable record of Miller's views on theatre, including such topics as the origins of modern drama, the nature of tragedy, what makes plays endure, the theatre in Russia and in the US. They give eloquent expression of his belief in 'the theatre as a serious business, one that makes or should make man more human, which is to say, less alone'.<br><br> This volume draws together essays from three earlier publications: <i>Echoes Down the Corridor, The Theatre Essays of Arthur Miller</i> and <i>The Crucible in History</i>.

They also argue that one of the Indian chiefs has been misidentified and show that Trumbull&#39;s own notes and inscriptions point to the correct name. By chance, Trumbull was painting George Washington&#39;s portrait for the City of New York when a delegation of Creeks arrived to sign the Treaty of New York. Finding himself in the company of the Creeks, the artist seized the opportunity to draw them. While Drawing By Stealth tells the history of these iconic drawings of American Indians, it also provides details about the clothing and ornaments depicted and corrects a popular -- but erroneous -- theory that one of the images is of the leader of the Creek delegation to New York, Alexander McGillivray.</p><p></p><h2>Becoming American?: The Forging of Arab and Muslim Identity in Pluralist America</h2><p><p>Countless generations of Arabs and Muslims have called the United States "home." Yet while diversity and pluralism continue to define contemporary America, many Muslims are viewed by their neighbors as painful reminders of conflict and violence. In this concise volume, renowned historian Yvonne Haddad argues that American Muslim identity is as uniquely American it is for as any other race, nationality, or religion.</p><p> <i>Becoming American? </i>first traces the history of Arab and Muslim immigration into Western society during the 19th and 20th centuries, revealing a two-fold disconnect between the cultures&#x2015;America's unwillingness to accept these new communities at home and the activities of radical Islam abroad. Urging America to reconsider its tenets of religious pluralism, Haddad reveals that the public square has more than enough room to accommodate those values and ideals inherent in the moderate Islam flourishing throughout the country. In all, in remarkable, succinct fashion, Haddad prods readers to ask what it means to be truly American and paves the way forward for not only increased understanding but for forming a Muslim message that is capable of uplifting American society.</p></p><p>Who is Arab?

Wodehouse) was an English humorist and writer best known for his Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels. Educated at boarding schools, Wodehouse turned to writing at a young age, demonstrating great skill at humorous sketches and musical lyrics. He continued to write part-time while pursuing, at the behest of his father, a career in banking, and successfully contributed numerous pieces to Punch, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Express, among other publications. In addition to his literary work, Wodehouse was incorporated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in recognition of his collaboration with Cole Porter on Anything Goes, his lyrics to the song Bill from Show Boat, and his work on the musicals Rosalie and The Three Musketeers.<p>While interned along with other British citizens in Germany during the Second World War, Wodehouse made a series of radio broadcasts for which he was accused of being a collaborator; and, although later cleared of the charges, he never returned to England.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>Reviewed with Paul W. Lovinger's The Penguin Dictionary of American English Usage and Style.<p>Like Laurence Urdang's <i>The Dictionary of Confusable Words</i> (1988), Room's new work considers pairs and sets of words that are subject to uncertainty in the minds of even native speakers of English. Room takes confusables such as <i>correspondent</i> /<i>co-respondent</i> , <i>mold</i> /<i>mil</i> dew, and <i>quiet</i> /<i>quiescent</i> and clearly and succinctly explains how they differ. In this modus operandi (which, incidentally, Room distinguishes from <i>modus vivendi</i> ) the author mirrors Urdang. However, Room also provides an example of each confusable in a plausible sentence.The books overlap even while each includes words the other omits. Turn to Urdang for <i>cray</i> fish/<i>shrimp</i> /<i>lobster</i> /<i>krill</i> , <i>initiative</i> /<i>referendum</i> /<i>recall</i> , or <i>symphony</i> /<i>concerto</i> , none of which find room in Room. Along with their differences in word stock, they differ in access methods. Urdang provides an index, whereas Room achieves the same result by using <i>see</i> references to guide readers to words that fall in the latter part of an entry heading. In short, libraries, writers, and others will find both useful because sometimes one will do but the other won't.The most significant difference between the two is Urdang's selection of entries that touch on usage more than meaning. These include his disquisitions on <i>either . . . or</i> /<i>neither . . . nor</i> and <i>lie</i> /<i>lay</i> , topics also addressed in <i>The Penguin Dictio</i> nary of American English Usage and Style, a book with a broader purpose that embraces a lengthy entry explaining the differences between the elements of "Confusing Pairs." Lovinger, a journalist and freelance writer, has written this dictionary as a reference for writers and as a textbook that would-be careful writers can read to their benefit. Using the unimpeachable touchstone of clarity, his highly readable entries explain why a certain expression or usage is superior to alternatives. His article on <i>only </i> and how to place it properly among other words to convey one's intended meaning exemplifies this value. Furthermore, he provides context and foundation for his explanations. For example, the technicalities in the expression <i>between you </i> and I will make sense to the uninformed if they follow the helpful <i>see also</i> reference to the lengthy article explaining prepositions, their history, their use, etc. He provides similar background articles for other parts of speech. Even with these, however, some of his terminology (e.g., <i>restrictive clauses</i> ) might be meaningless to readers who have not been schooled in traditional grammar.Lovinger cites numerous examples to make and buttress his points, drawing many of these from newspaper articles. These tend to illustrate practices to avoid. In his commentary on these quotes, he can sometimes come across as a bit of a curmudgeon, as, for example, when he castigates reporters who use <i>remap</i> as a synonym for <i>reapportion</i> .

It is estimated that there are now up to one hundred thousand German converts&#x2015;a number similar to that in France and the United Kingdom. What stands out about recent conversions is that they take place at a time when Islam is increasingly seen as contrary to European values. <i>Being German, Becoming Muslim</i> explores how Germans come to Islam within this antagonistic climate, how they manage to balance their love for Islam with their society's fear of it, how they relate to immigrant Muslims, and how they shape debates about race, religion, and belonging in today&#x2019;s Europe.</p><p>Esra �zy�rek looks at how mainstream society marginalizes converts and questions their national loyalties. In turn, converts try to disassociate themselves from migrants of Muslim-majority countries and promote a denationalized Islam untainted by Turkish or Arab traditions. Some German Muslims believe that once cleansed of these accretions, the Islam that surfaces fits in well with German values and lifestyle. Others even argue that being a German Muslim is wholly compatible with the older values of the German Enlightenment.</p><p><i>Being German, Becoming Muslim</i> provides a fresh window into the connections and tensions stemming from a growing religious phenomenon in Germany and beyond.</p></p><p><p>"Through thoughtful portraits, �zy�rek explores the dilemmas faced by converts to Islam in Germany, where new Muslims are seeking nonethnic forms of the religion. She shows how these converts are finding an original way to be German through their Islam--a discovery that seems dangerous to some in the German state. A clear, convincing account of new Muslims in a European land."<b>--John Bowen, author of <i>Can Islam Be French?</i></b></p><p>"In a society where 'Muslim' has come to imply 'nonwhite immigrant,' and where German-Islam for many is a contradiction of identity, how do native German Muslims tread across these conundra? �zy�rek's engaging and penetrating book leads us through the issues and reveals as much about Germany and a select group of Germans as it does about Islam."<b>--Ruth Mandel, University College London</b></p><p>"This book offers both a call and a hope. �zy�rek shows the tremendous role of Muslim converts in making Islam a German and European religion, and she calls converts to meet this challenge. She also presents the common hope of everyone 'living together' in unity, and her book is an important contribution to the achievement of this goal."<b>--Tariq Ramadan, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"Given the current position of Islam in Europe, why do Europeans convert? What do the experiences of converts reveal about contemporary life, particularly in Germany? This rich book offers a new perspective and entr�e into the discussion of religion in Europe."<b>--Damani J. Partridge, University of Michigan</b></p><p>"�zy�rek has written an engaging, highly readable portrait of German converts to Islam who have become key figures in public debates over the future of the country as a multireligious, multiethnic polity. The book serves as a primer on the history of Islam in Germany and plumbs the limits of European secularism.

Out of their struggle, the unfulfilled passion of his heroine, and the daily rhythms of late-nineteenth-century rural life, Hardy builds a drama fully worthy of the magnificent stage on which he places it. <br><br><i>The Return of the Native</i> is dominated by the brooding presence of Egdon Heath, located in Thomas Hardy&#x2019;s imaginary Wessex, and in no other book did Hardy&#x2019;s extraordinary feeling for landscape blend so perfectly with his austere, stoic vision of human fate.<br><br>Once more he treats his favorite theme of the mismatched couple with masterly pathos and understatement.</p></p><p>This fine novel sets in opposition two of Thomas Hardy&#39;s most unforgettable creations: his heroine, the sensuous, free-spirited Eustacia Vye, and the solemn, majestic stretch of upland in Dorsetshire he called Egdon Heath. The famous opening reveals the haunting power of that dark, forbidding moon where proud Eustacia fervently awaits a clandestine meeting with her lover, Damon Wildeve. But Eustacia&#39;s dreams of escape are not to be realized--neither Wildeve nor the returning native Clym Yeobright can bring her salvation. Injured by forces beyond their control, Hardy&#39;s characters struggle vainly in the net of destiny. In the end, only the face of the lonely heath remains untouched by fate in this masterpiece of tragic passion, a tale that perfectly epitomizes the author&#39;s own unique and melancholy genius.Leak and savage, Egdon Heath seems to breathe darkness and it claws back those who rise above it. Against this background Hardy&#39;s players come together, weaving a web of deceit and death.</p><h2>Pocket Oxford American Dictionary</h2><p>Extensively redesigned and rewritten, the second edition of <em>Pocket Oxford American Dictionary</em> combines its highly popular, pocket-sized packaging with a dramatic revision of the copy, with completely reworded entries throughout.<br><br>With more than 140,000 words, phrases, and definitions, including a wealth of new words, sample sentences, and usage notes, this marvelous edition makes it easier than ever before to find the correct meaning of a word.

But in this volume, Marvin Lowenthal has drawn from his letters, essays, travel writings, and manuscripts to create a biography of his life told in his own words, thereby fulfilling Montaigne s intention of presenting his self-portrait to the world. For it was Montaigne who wrote, My book and I are one, and into his writing he poured the amazing varieties of his perceptions, his unflinching powers of observation and analysis, and his deeply felt love of humanity in all its messy contrariness. Above his desk, on a beam on his ceiling, were inscribed the words nihil humani alieni mihi puto : nothing human is alien to me and nothing was, for into his writing he distilled his tender heart and biting wit, his nonsense and wisdom, his passions and his hates. By collecting and arranging these autobiographical passages into a unified whole, Lowenthal has framed a complete portrait in this rich and rewarding book. All of Montaigne is here: his adventures and love affairs, his marriage, travels, tastes, and opinions. Seldom has so much wit, wisdom, and pure entertainment been packed into a single volume.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchA country-gentleman of the days of Henry III, who was a wise man in a century of ignorance, a philosopher in an age of fanatics, and who painted in the guise of himself our own follies and frailties, is a man who will be loved forever. --Voltaire<br><br>Montaigne is really the first modern writer the first who showed that an author might be original and charming, even classical, if he did not try too hard. --James Russell Lowell<br><br>That such a man has written truly increases the pleasure of living...It is by his side I would range myself if I had to acclimate myself to this world.<br>--Nietzsche<br>Montaigne is the frankest and honestest of all writers...

It makes accessible to students, scholars, and general readers the breadth of the slavery debate. Including many previously inaccessible documents, <i>A House Divided</i> is a critical and welcome contribution to a literature that includes only a few volumes of antislavery writings and no volumes of proslavery documents in print.</p><br><p> Mason Lowance's introduction is an excellent overview of the antebellum slavery debate and its key issues and participants. Lowance also introduces each selection, locating it historically, culturally, and thematically as well as linking it to other writings. The documents represent the full scope of the varied debates over slavery. They include examples of race theory, Bible-based arguments for and against slavery, constitutional analyses, writings by former slaves and women's rights activists, economic defenses and critiques of slavery, and writings on slavery by such major writers as William Lloyd Garrison, John Greenleaf Whittier, Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Together they give readers a real sense of the complexity and heat of the vexed conversation that increasingly dominated American discourse as the country moved from early nationhood into its greatest trial.</p></p><p><p>"The anthology makes available a large body of primary documents, many of them hitherto rare or inaccessible. The texts are expertly chosen and excerpted. Of remarkable variety and scope, they investigate slavery from all angles--pro and con, religious and secular, male and female, scientific and exhortatory, and so on. Their publication is timely and most welcome. The volume also provides an illuminating, superbly comprehensive, insightful, and concise history of the slavery debate."<b>--David S.

Two tapes had<br>previously been made by the same bi-dialectal African American<br>speaker, one in African American language (as distinguished by vocabulary,<br>syntax, and pronunciation)and one in American Standard<br>English. A tape player with one of the tapes was put into each box,<br>out of the children&#x2019;s view. Each box was described as a head&#x201d; and<br>each relayed the same messages. The voice in each box introduced<br>itself to the children and indicated that it had a present for the child.<br>Later, each box also asked the children if they would give the<br>speaker their crayons. The children were then asked a number of<br>questions, including these: Which head,&#x201d; Steve [Standard English]<br>or Kenneth [Black English], would you like to get the present<br>from? Whom do you like better? Whom would you like to play<br>with? Whom would you give your crayons to?<br> <br>Over 70 percent of the time, both African American and European<br>American three- to five-year-olds categorized the BE speaker<br>as African American and the SE speaker as white. Further, most<br>of them wanted the present from the SE speaker because he had<br>nicer presents.&#x201d; The majority of the children of both ethnicities<br>believed that the BE speaker, Kenneth, needed&#x201d; the crayons more,<br>with one European American boy, aged five and a half, saying that<br>he would give his crayons to Kenneth cause he don&#x2019;t have nothing&#x201d;<br>and one four-year-old European American girl indicating that<br>she was afraid of Kenneth (Rosenthal, p.62).<br> <br>The findings are fascinating. They indicate, according to the<br>researcher, that very young children have developed attitudes toward<br>African American language and assumptions about its speakers<br>that closely parallel adult American views:<br> <br>Interestingly, the African American and white children reflected<br>differences in their personal preferences towards the<br>representative speakers of the two language forms, with the<br>white children preferring the SE speaker and the African<br>American children preferring the BE speaker. Furthermore,<br>there were expressions of learned stereotyped images associated<br>with both speakers. Many of these were pejorative toward<br>the BE speaker identifying him as talking silly, being<br>unintelligible, being harmful, having nothing, and not having<br>drawing ability. . . . The SE speaker was stereotyped as being<br>more gentle, looking better, having better drawing ability,<br>and being the symbol of success (the last idea was expressed<br>by Population B [African American]).<br> <br>It should not be surprising that these attitudes carry over into<br>school. In another study done in the 1970s, student teachers were<br>asked to assess eight hypothetical schoolchildren on the scales of<br>intelligence, being a good student, being privileged, enthusiastic,<br>self-confident, and gentle [Giles &amp; Powesland, 1975:3, cited in R. A.<br>Hudson, Sociolinguistics, Cambridge University Press, 1980]. The<br>eight hypothetical students were each defined by three types of<br>information: a photograph, a tape-recorded sample of speech, and<br>a sample of school work (consisting of an essay and a drawing).<br>Each piece of information was based on a real child, but the pieces<br>were recombined to give equal numbers of occasions in which each<br>type of information would be judged positively and negatively.<br>Hudson (1980)describes the study results:<br> <br>The question to be answered by this experiment was: what<br>would happen if information from one source gave a favourable<br>impression but that from another source gave an unfavourable<br>one? The very clear answer was that information<br>from the speech sample always [emphasis added] took priority<br>over that from the photograph or the school-work: a favourable<br>impression on the speech sample overrode unfavourable<br>impressions from the other sources, and conversely. (p. 208)<br> <br>As Michael Stubbs contends (in chapter 5), if school considers<br>someone&#x2019;s language inadequate, they&#x2019;ll probably fail.<br> <br>Our language embraces us long before we are defined by any other<br>medium of identity. In our mother&#x2019;s womb we hear and feel the<br>sounds, the rhythms, the cadences of our mother tongue.&#x201d; We<br>learn to associate contentment with certain qualities of voice and<br>physical disequilibrium with others. Our home language is as viscerally<br>tied to our beings as existence itself as the sweet sounds<br>of love accompany our first milk, as our father&#x2019;s pride permeates<br>our bones and flesh when he shows us off to his friends, as a gentle<br>lullaby or soft murmurs signal release into restful sleep. It is no<br>wonder that our first language becomes intimately connected to<br>our identity.<br> <br>Just as our skin provides us with a means to negotiate our interactions<br>with the world both in how we perceive our surroundings<br>and in how those around us perceive us our language plays<br>an equally pivotal role in determining who we are: it is <i>The Skin<br>That We Speak.</i> <br> <br>For better or worse, in our stratified society our appearance can<br>serve to create an expectation of success or failure, of brilliance or<br>stupidity, of power or impotence. Those whose skin color or hair<br>texture or facial features do not place them within the dominant phenotype<br>are often viewed as lesser than.&#x201d; But our language skin&#x201d;<br>provides an even more precise mechanism for determining status.<br>The omission of an s,&#x201d; an unusual inflection, or a nasalized word<br>ending can indicate to listeners exactly where in the social hierarchy<br>a speaker should be assigned. Victoria Purcell-Gates sums it up in<br>the title of her chapter, . . . As Soon As She Opened Her Mouth!&#x201d;<br> <br>The purpose of this 2002 collection is to explore the links between<br>language and identity, between language and political hierarchy,<br>and between language and cultural conflict.<br> <br>Most of the articles in this collection make reference to African<br>American language (also called Black English, Ebonics, or African<br>American Vernacular English), which is, without question, one of<br>the most vigorously debated linguistic codes in our nation&#x2019;s history.<br>As early as 1884, J. Harrison attempted to detail in a fifty-sevenpage<br>treatise that the language of Negroes&#x201d; was an oddity that<br>only vaguely resembled language at all.<br> <br>This volume also concerns itself primarily with language and<br>education. This issue of language use in school is particularly volatile.<br>The commencement of formal education is usually one of<br>the first settings in a person&#x2019;s life when their language may be<br>judged as right or wrong; when assumptions may be made about<br>their intelligence, family life, future potential, or moral fiber every<br>time a sentence is uttered. African American language has had a<br>particularly stormy relationship with the educational power structure.<br>Schools often see themselves, and are seen by the larger society,<br>as the arbiters of what is proper, correct, and decent. African<br>American language forms have been considered none of the above.<br>Thus, there have been continual moves to eliminate its presence<br>in classrooms, and raging debates whenever it appears that there<br>might be some move to suggest otherwise.<br> <br>The most recent flare-up, the so-called Ebonics Debate,&#x201d; took<br>the country by storm during 1996 and 1997. The Oakland School<br>District put forth a proposal that named the language form spoken<br>by many of its African American students Ebonics.&#x201d; It not only<br>provided a moniker, but the proposal also declared Ebonics a distinct<br>language, not a dialect or substandard form of English. Further,<br>it recommended that teachers be trained in the elements of<br>Ebonics and steeped in aspects of African American culture. Such<br>training, they argued, would enable teachers to create instruction<br>for African American students that would allow them not only to<br>excel in learning standard English, but to excel in all school subjects.<br>This result had already been achieved on a small scale using<br>the program the board advocated, the Standard English Proficiency<br>Program.&#x201d; Despite the school board&#x2019;s good intentions, the<br>country went on a rampage, with reporter after reporter declaring<br>that Oakland was planning to teach Black slang and ghetto language<br>to its schoolchildren. Several of the essays in this volume<br>refer to the debate, and more details of the battle are described in<br>chapter 3, No Kinda Sense. Also included, as an appendix, is the<br>formal response of the Linguistic Society of America on the Oakland<br>Ebonics debate.<br> <br>However, this was not the first time African American language<br>and the education establishment engaged in a very awkward, painful,<br>and public dance. After the riots of the 1960s the general public<br>became aware that African American children were failing in<br>schools in large numbers. African American leaders and, later, President<br>Johnson&#x2019;s War on Poverty&#x201d; demanded solutions. Educational<br>scholars, casting about for blame, speculated about the cause<br>of the problem and hit upon the idea that the children&#x2019;s inferior<br>language was the cause of their learning problem. With little or<br>no empirical research to back the claims, what amounted to rumors<br>were circulated through articles, essays, and speeches indicating<br>that African American children had a miniscule vocabulary, were<br>nonverbal, had no substantive communicative exchanges with their<br>parents, and were crushed by the noise and confusion in their<br>homes. The Head Start Program, in large part, was initiated to<br>mitigate the culturally and linguistically deprived&#x201d; homes of poor<br>African American children.<br> <br>Linguists, mostly white, began to study the question. The<br>language was mapped and its unique grammatical features, phonology,<br>and semantics were identified. In contrast to the educators,<br>most linguists concluded that there was nothing inherently inferior<br>about the language of African Americans, but that problems might<br>arise when the language of school and the language of home met.<br>Some African American scholars began to take issue with the work<br>of the white linguists, suggesting that, at best, they were unable<br>to really understand Black language because the language did not<br>exist apart from the culture and they had insufficient access to the<br>culture. It was during this period that the term Ebonics&#x201d; (black<br> phonics, i.e., black sounds)was coined by Professor Robert Williams<br>in the early 1970s, when he convened a meeting of African<br>American scholars to study the question from a culturally specific<br>perspective. He proposed that the white linguists were wrong to<br>consider African American language to be a dialect of English,<br>since the linguistic code really had its roots in West African languages.<br>As the controversy continued, accusations of opportunism,<br>self-aggrandizement, and being in league with the government&#x2019;s<br>attempts to keep African Americans disenfranchised eventually led<br>many white linguists to seek other areas of study (Shuy in Farr-<br>Whiteman).<br> <br>The next major public explosion concerning African American<br>language and the schools was in 1979, when, in what came to be<br>known as the <i>King</i> case,&#x201d; parents from the Green Road Housing<br>Project in Detroit sued the school system for not educating their<br>children, specifically for failing to teach them to read. The judge<br>in the case, Judge Joiner, eventually dismissed all of the plaintiffs&#x2019;<br>claims except one, forcing the lawsuit to be tried only on 1703(f),<br>which reads in part: No state shall deny equal educational opportunity<br>to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex,<br>or national origin, by . . . the failure to overcome language barriers<br>that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional<br>programs.&#x201d;<br> <br>The judge eventually ruled in the plaintiffs&#x2019; favor, and declared<br>that the teachers and the school system had not taken into account<br>the children&#x2019;s language in their instruction, and thus had failed to<br>teach them appropriately. He ruled that the school board had not<br>previously, but now should (1) help the teachers understand the<br>problem&#x201d;; (2) help provide them with knowledge about the children&#x2019;s<br>use of a black English&#x2019; language system&#x201d;; and (3) suggest<br>ways and means of using that knowledge in teaching the students<br>to read.&#x201d; The plaintiffs&#x2019; lawyers did not think the solution, without<br>any accountability or classroom intervention, went far enough. The<br>public, however, went wild. The media once more peppered the<br>airways and newspapers with suggestions that the judge was equating<br>Black slang and improper English with a true language.<br> <br>In the Ebonics debate of 1996, in the War on Poverty reports<br>and counter reports of the 1960s and early 1970s, and in the furor<br>surrounding the <i>King</i> case in the early 1980s, the public discussions<br>and publicized scholarly research ended rather suddenly, and with<br>no resolution. Still today African American children fail, and still<br>there is much smoke and little light around the linguistic issues<br>that might affect that failure. Two major professional organizations<br>of English educators have been discussing the educational costs of<br>language discrimination for more than twenty-five years, passing<br> <i>Students&#x2019; Right to Their Own Language</i> in 1974 and the National<br>Language Policy in 1988. A survey taken in 2000 by the NCTE &amp;<br>CCCC, however, showed that fully one-third of the membership<br>had no knowledge of the positions the organizations had taken.<br> <br>During each of the peaks of public interest in African American<br>language and education, scholars have pointed out, but with little<br>public attention, that it may not be the children&#x2019;s language that<br>causes educational problems, but the educational bureaucracy&#x2019;s response<br>to the language. These scholars looked more to attitudes<br>held about the language. They posited that the country&#x2019;s perception<br>of African Americans was such that, given the history of racism in<br>the United States, it attached inferiority to all things black.<br></p><h2>Sister Carrie (Modern Library)</h2><p>"American writing, before and after Dreiser's time, differed almost as much as biology before and after Darwin," said H. L. Mencken. Sister Carrie, Dreiser's great first novel, transformed the conventional "fallen woman" story into a bold and truly innovative piece of fiction when it appeared in 1900. Na�ve young Caroline Meeber, a small-town girl seduced by the lure of the modern city, becomes the mistress of a traveling salesman and then of a saloon manager, who elopes with her to New York. Both its subject matter and Dreiser's unsparing, nonjudgmental approach made Sister Carrie a controversial book in its time, and the work retains the power to shock readers today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister Carrie came to housebound and airless America like a great <br>free Western wind, and to our <br>stuffy domesticity gave us the first <br>fresh air since Mark Twain and Whitman," noted Sinclair Lewis. "Dreiser enlarged, willy-nilly, by <br>a kind of historical accident if <br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford-<br>able hardbound editions of impor-<br>tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-<br>fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring<br>as its emblem the running torch-<br>bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-<br>gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p><i>Sister Carrie</i>, Theodore Dreiser's revolutionary first novel, was published in 1900--sort of. The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored "author's cut" of <i>Sister Carrie</i> that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing.<p> Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by <i>Sister Carrie</i>'s last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i></p>Theodore Dreiser had a hardscrabble youth and the years of newspaper work behind him when he began his first novel, <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the story of a beautiful Midwestern girl who makes it big in New York City. Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.</p><h2>The Oxford Picture Dictionary: English-Brazilian Portuguese Edition</h2><p>A comprehensive, flexible, and up-to-date vocabulary reference and teaching tool for English language learning.<br><br>The Oxford Picture Dictionary and its components create a highly teachable programme that can be used as a complete, four-skills beginning course, or as a language development supplement and practical reference. h4span style="font-size: smaller; color: #ff0000"NEW /span Grammar Activity<br>Book/h4</p><p>Norma Shapiro has been involved with language teaching since 1982.

Consumed around the world by millions, they appeal to young and old, affluent and impoverished alike. The authors examine the history, manufacturing, marketing, and consumption of instant noodles. By focusing on three specific markets, they reveal various ways in which these noodles enable diverse populations to manage their lives. The first market is in Japan, where instant noodles have facilitated a major transformation of post-war society, while undergoing a seemingly endless tweaking in flavors, toppings, and packaging in order to entice consumers. The second is in the United States, where instant noodles have become important to many groups including college students, their nostalgic parents, and prison inmates. The authors also take note of &#x201c;heavy users,&#x201d; a category of the chronically hard-pressed targeted by U.S. purveyors. The third is in Papua New Guinea, where instant noodles arrived only recently and are providing cheap food options to the urban poor, all the while transforming them into aspiring consumers.

It was the fall of 1813, and Colonel Timotheus von Bock, a Baltic nobleman and a favorite of the czar, had returned from the battlefields of Europe a hero, convinced that new and better ways were coming, and determined to play his part in bringing them about. He first scandalized his fellow aristocrats by spurning a far more appropriate marriage in order to wed a peasant&#39;s daughter. Then he committed an even more grievous infraction. Having sworn an oath to his sovereign always to tell him the truth, von Bock sent the czar a memorandum condemning his tyrannical rule. The reaction was prompt. Von Bock was banished from his estate and imprisoned for nine years in the Schlusselburg fortress. When Czar Alexander was succeeded by his brother Nicholas I, von Bock was released at last, and he returned under close surveillance to his impoverished estate and his destitute wife. His physical health had been shattered by his imprisonment no less than his mental stability. Was he indeed the madman the czar certified him to be whose unstable mind had led him to his subversive ideas? Or was he really a utopian revolutionary, a man of the highest moral principles? Timo von Bock&#39;s story is the main thread in a richly worked tapestry evoking the world of nineteenth-century Russia and its Baltic provinces after the fall of Napoleon - a time of great turmoil that saw the birth of a new national awareness among the many peoples unwillingly held under the rule of the Russian crown. Recounting thiscompelling tale from the pages of history, Jaan Kross takes the reader deep into the passions of a time and a country that foreshadow the tragedies of our own century, creating at the same time a powerful vision of human emotion: honor and knavery, greed and sacrifice, love and desire. The Czar&#39;s Madman combines the elements of a gripping historical novel with the profound sensibilities of a great writer wrestling with the deepest moral issues of our day. The Czar&#39;s Madman was awarded the Literature Prize of Amnesty International&#39;s French affiliate in 1990.Born in 1920 in Estonia, Jaan Kross was arrested by the Soviets in 1946 and spent nine years in exile and labor camps in the Soviet Union's eastern regions. He has published eleven works of fiction, including the highly acclaimed <i>The Czar&#x2019;s Madman</i>, as well as four volumes of poetry. Although English-speaking audiences are only now discovering his work, his books have been translated into twenty-two languages and have sold more than one million copies worldwide.<br></p><h2>Berklee Contemporary Music Notation</h2><p>(Berklee Guide).

James was a leading thinker of the late nineteenth century, one of the most influential U.S. philosophers, and has been labelled the "Father of American psychology".</p><p>Along with Charles Sanders Peirce, James established the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology. A Review of General Psychology analysis, published in 2002, ranked James as the 14th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century. A survey published in American Psychologist in 1991 ranked James's reputation in second place, after Wilhelm Wundt, who is widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology. James also developed the philosophical perspective known as radical empiricism. James' work has influenced intellectuals such as �mile Durkheim, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty, and has even influenced former US President Jimmy Carter.</p><p>Born into a wealthy family, James was the son of the Swedenborgian theologian Henry James Sr. and the brother of both the prominent novelist Henry James and the diarist Alice James. James trained as a physician and taught anatomy at Harvard, but never practiced medicine. Instead he pursued his interests in psychology and then philosophy. James wrote widely on many topics, including epistemology, education, metaphysics, psychology, religion, and mysticism. Among his most influential books are The Principles of Psychology, a groundbreaking text in the field of psychology; Essays in Radical Empiricism, an important text in philosophy; and The Varieties of Religious Experience, an investigation of different forms of religious experience, including theories on mind-cure.</p><p>&#x201c;The Varieties of Religious Experience&#x201d; comprises James&#x2019; edited Gifford Lectures on natural theology, which were delivered at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1901 and 1902. The lectures concerned the nature of religion and the neglect of science in the academic study of religion.</p><p>Soon after its publication, Varieties entered the Western canon of psychology and philosophy and has remained in print for over a century.</p><p>James later developed his philosophy of pragmatism. There are many overlapping ideas in Varieties and his 1907 book, Pragmatism.

Taking place in 1870s Victorian London,&nbsp;the&nbsp;characters are&nbsp;comprised of a motley cast of financiers, investors, and determined social-climbers.<br>Despite rumors of an unsavory past, Augustus Melmotte is so vastly wealthy that the London society receives him with open arms. In addition to furthering his schemes of railway fraud, the ruthless financier's entry into society launches his daughter into the matrimonial market. Her preferred suitor, Sir Felix Carbury, is a penniless wastrel whose mother aspires to literary and financial success&nbsp;not so much by writing good books but by using her feminine charms to get ahead. A host of other bounders and rogues populate the pages of this tale, which begins as a satire and concludes as a delicious social comedy. Rejected by critics upon its 1875 publication, <i>The Way We Live Now</i> is recognized today as Anthony Trollope's masterpiece.</p><p>Trollope&#39;s 1875 tale of a great financier&#39;s fraudulent machinations in the railway business, and his daughter&#39;s ill-use at the hands of a grasping lover (for whom she steals funds in order to elope) is a classic in the literature of money and a ripping good read as well."Trollope did not write for posterity," observed Henry James. "He wrote for the day, the moment; but these are just the writers whom posterity is apt to put into its pocket." Considered by contemporary critics to be Trollope's greatest novel, The Way We Live Now is a satire of the literary world of London in the 1870s and a bold indictment of the new power of speculative finance in English life. "I was instigated by what I conceived to be the commercial profligacy of the age," Trollope said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope knew well the difficulties of dealing with editors, publishers, reviewers, and the public; his portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His picture of late nineteenth century England is of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy, where the traditional virtues of Tory squirearchy, represented by Roger Carbury, prove to be no match for the financial genius of Augustus Melmotte. In The Way We Live Now Trollope combines his talents as a portraitist and his skills as a storyteller to give us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago.</p><h2>Penguin Minis: Anne of Green Gables (The Puffin Bloom Collection)</h2><p><b>The cherished favorite featuring everyone's favorite red-headed orphan, now in a revolutionary new mini format with a beautiful cover illustration by Anna Bond, the artist behind world-renowned stationery brand, Rifle Paper Co.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This beloved classic is now available as a Penguin Mini.

Here are the ideas of apologists, propagandists, and poets about the Crusades, as well as the perceptions and motives of the crusaders themselves and the means by which they joined the movement.<br> The authors describe the elaborate social and civic systems that arose to support the Crusades--taxation, for example, was formalized by the Church and monarchs to raise enormous funds needed to wage war on this scale. And here are vivid descriptions of the battles themselves, frightening, disorienting, and dangerous affairs, with keen and insightful commentary on the reactions of the Muslims to a Christian holy war. Extensively illustrated with hundreds of photographs, paintings, drawings, maps, chronologies, and a guide to further reading, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the</em> <em>Crusades</em> even includes coverage of crusades outside the eastern Mediterranean region and post-medieval crusades.<br> From descriptions of the battles and homefront conditions, to a thorough evaluation of the clash (and coalescence) of cultures, to the legacy of the crusading movement that continues into our conflict-torn twentieth-century, to the enduring artistic and social changes that the Crusades wrought, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades</em> offers an informative, engaging, and unsurpassed panorama of one of the great movements in western history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Riley-Smith</strong> is Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge and is one of the world's leading authorities on the Crusades. His previous publications include <em>The Atlas of the Crusades</em> and <em>The Crusades: A Short History</em>.<br>In 1095 Pope Urban II granted absolutions to whomever would reclaim the Holy Land for Christendom. With that assurance began two centuries of Crusades, and the story, in contemporary chronicles, artwork, and castellated ruins, is well treated in this interpretation of the movement to take up the cross. The subject has stirred from historiographical dormancy, says editor Riley-Smith, who ably introduces the definitional questions--What is a Crusade? Who became a Crusader?--and then turns the chapters over to a dozen specialists. They analyze in detail the complex religious, economic, and military aspects, emphasizing the immediate instigation of one Crusade or another--often a Muslim counter-Crusade like Saladin's recapture of Jerusalem in 1187--while reiterating the profound piety and concern for salvation on which the whole process rested. It seems an odd combination of compassion and conquest, aptly expressed in knightly orders such as Hospitallers or the Teutonic Order, so elusive to the modern sensibility. These historians, though, dissolve that psychological barrier, interpreting what impelled the pilgrims, the Muslim reaction, and the political course of holy conflict up through the fall of the last Crusader polity--Malta--in 1798. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Stories of Daily Life from the Roman World: Extracts from the Ancient Colloquia</h2><p>What did Roman children do first when they arrived at school in the morning? What excuse for missing school could be counted on to stave off a whipping from the teacher? What did a Roman banker do when someone came to borrow money? What did a Roman wife say when her husband came home drunk? The answers to such questions can be found not in mainstream ancient literature (whose writers had their minds on higher things) but in language textbooks for ancient Latin learners. These &#39;colloquia&#39; offer an ancient introduction to Roman culture, covering such areas as shopping, banking, bathing, dining, arguing, and going to school; recently rediscovered, they are here presented for the first time in a format aimed at readers with no prior knowledge of Latin, Greek, or the ancient world.

Your choices will now connect what you believe in the spiritual realm with what you do in the temporal world. But making that connection doesn&#x2019;t always come naturally. That&#x2019;s where the creeds, confessions, and spiritual disciplines that have nurtured and strengthened believers throughout Christian history can also help you. </p><p>One such devotional aid is the Heidelberg Catechism, written during the Reformation. Randal Working incorporates this question-and-answer survey of the apostle Paul&#x2019;s epistle to the Romans into a devotional format that follows a simple outline: </p><p>- Guilt&#x2014;our utter brokenness and need for redemption<br> - Grace&#x2014;what God has done to redeem and restore us to a right relationship with Him<br> - Gratitude&#x2014;our response to grace, demonstrated by a new way of living </p><p>In addition to providing a 52-week "mini Bible course" on Romans, From Rebellion to Redemption deftly weaves the study with prayer, Scripture reading, writings from a broad spectrum of Christian thinkers, and commentary with questions for reflection and discussion. The combination produces a rich worship experience built around the exploration of key doctrines of our faith. The result is a systematic and personal approach for individual or group study that allows you to take spiritual inventory, consider the great themes of Christianity, and find strength for your journey into deeper intimacy with God.</p></p><p>RANDAL WORKING, the son of Presbyterian pastors, graduated from the University of Washington with a master of fine arts in drawing and painting.

Hugo sweeps readers from the French provinces to the back alleys of Paris, and from the battlefield of Waterloo to the bloody ramparts of Paris during the uprising of 1832. <br><br>First published in 1862, this sprawling novel is an extravagant historical epic that is teeming with harrowing adventures and unforgettable characters. In the protagonist, Jean Valjean, a quintessential prisoner of conscience who languished for years in prison for stealing bread to feed his starving family, <i>Les Mis�rables</i> depicts one of the grand themes in literature&#x2013;that of the hunted man.

Corporate Finance, A Focused Approach.</p><p></p><h2>Innovation in Cultural Systems: Contributions from Evolutionary Anthropology (Vienna Series in Theoretical Biology (12))</h2><p><p><b>Leading scholars offer a range of perspectives on the roles played by innovation in the evolution of human culture.</b></p><p>In recent years an interest in applying the principles of evolution to the study of culture emerged in the social sciences. Archaeologists and anthropologists reconsidered the role of innovation in particular, and have moved toward characterizing innovation in cultural systems not only as a product but also as an evolutionary process. This distinction was familiar to biology but new to the social sciences; cultural evolutionists from the nineteenth to the twentieth century had tended to see innovation as a preprogrammed change that occurred when a cultural group &#x201c;needed&#x201d; to overcome environmental problems. In this volume, leading researchers from a variety of disciplines&#x2015;including anthropology, archaeology, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and psychology&#x2015;offer their perspectives on cultural innovation. The book provides not only a range of views but also an integrated account, with the chapters offering an orderly progression of thought. The contributors consider innovation in biological terms, discussing epistemology, animal studies, systematics and phylogeny, phenotypic plasticity and evolvability, and evo-devo; they discuss modern insights into innovation, including simulation, the random-copying model, diffusion, and demographic analysis; and they offer case studies of innovation from archaeological and ethnographic records, examining developmental, behavioral, and social patterns.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Andr� Ariew, R.

Written by best-selling children's author Marty Machowski, this beautifully illustrated picture book teaches children how to recognize the lure of temptation and the truth that bad choices lead to bad consequences. </p> <p> One day, Max takes the muddy path along the creek home, disregarding his mother's reminder to keep his school clothes clean. After crashing into a mud puddle, he tries to hide his mistake and discovers the stain of his sin goes deeper than the mud he can wash away. In this lovable, relatable, and heartwarming tale, Max learns his heart needs to be cleaned, and Jesus is the only one who can wash away his sin. </p> <p> By clearly articulating the gospel, <em>Don't Blame the Mud</em> helps parents create an environment of confession so kids can own up to their own mistakes in the freedom of Christ rather than place the blame elsewhere. Parents, teachers, and caretakers can help children identify with the real-life draw of temptation and the real-life consequences of sin, understanding the value of God's salvation through the cross. Instead of teaching kids how to deal with a problem, Machowski uncovers the real issue of sin and provides a gospel answer. </p></p><p><p>Marty Machowski is a Family Life Pastor at Covenant Fellowship Church in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, where he has served on the pastoral staff for over thirty years.

But with <i>Essentials of Asian Cuisine: Fundamentals and Favorite Recipes,</i> award-winning author Corinne Trang successfully brings the fundamentals of Asian cooking into the home kitchen in a collection that includes both contemporary and time-honored recipes.<p>Trang takes the reader on a journey of Eastern culinary discovery as seen through a practiced Western culinary lens. Explaining how and why Chinese cuisine is at the root of all Asian cooking, she describes in familiar terms the techniques that incorporate the five senses and embody the Chinese <i>yin yang</i> philosophy of balanced opposites. Trang uses Asian ingredients commonly found in supermarkets and through mail-order sources -- such as fish sauce, lemongrass, and rice noodles -- to guide home cooks through the preparation of healthy, sensual meals. She illuminates the mysteries of authentic Asian cooking, explaining the aromatic herbs and spices that make Asian cuisine vibrant, colorful, and distinctive.</p><p>Trang brings together more than three hundred traditional and cutting-edge recipes for condiments, appetizers, main courses, vegetables, and sweets and drinks from China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Mouthwatering items include Chinese Scallion Pancakes, Filipino Fried Spring Rolls, Spicy Indonesian Crab Fried Rice, Japanese Miso-Marinated Black Cod, Japanese Spring Water Tofu with Sweet Sake Sauce, Stir-Fried Leafy Greens, Chinese Pork Ribs with Black Bean and Garlic Sauce, Green Tea Ice Cream, and Thai Coffee. </p><p>In organizing the book by type of food, Trang allows cooks to see both the common elements and the distinctive individualities of Asian national and regional cooking. Trang explains the roots of major recipes and discusses where they appear in various guises in different countries. Vietnam's <i>Canh Ca Chua</i> (Hot and Sour Fish Soup), for example, can also be found in Cambodian, Indonesian, and Thai cuisines; Trang provides the recipes for both the master soup and its variations.</p><p>Trang includes a comprehensive glossary of Asian ingredients, plus a detailed list of resources for purchasing special ingredients and equipment. She offers sample menus, including a Chinese Dim Sum, a Filipino Dinner, and a Japanese Lunch. A special section on <i>feng shui</i> demonstrates how to organize and beautifully present a meal.</p><p>In this lavishly designed and illustrated volume, more than eighty-five original black-and-white and color photographs bring to life the ingredients, dishes, and people of Asia. The book is rich with personal anecdotes and intriguing information about Asian culture, and nowhere else will you find such a clear, comprehensive, and accessible treatment of Asian cuisine. More than a cookbook, <i>Essentials of Asian Cuisine</i> is a celebration of exotic culinary delights.</p><p></p></p><p>For so many of us, Asian cuisine beckons like a beautiful tropical pool. And yet, the most we ever do is test the water with a tremulous toe or two. But now Corinne Trang, award-winning author of <i>Authentic Vietnamese Cooking</i>, has taken on the prodigious task of being both swimming teacher and siren, lifeguard and fearless mariner, to lure us into the deep water with her <i>Essentials of Asian Cuisine</i>. <p> At 590-plus pages, this is a big book. It is beautifully illustrated, for those who need to see where they are headed, and just as beautifully thought out, for those who want to get where they are going. The destination is the food of Asia, with China as the wellspring. The territory Ms. Trang has mapped includes Indonesia and the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and Korea--as well as greater China. She does not pretend to be definitive--that would take an encyclopedia. Rather, Ms. Trang assures the reader that much of what they know of western cooking applies to the east. She begins with familiarity then builds in self confidence, chapter by chapter, recipe by recipe.</p><p> There are detailed sections on the Asian pantry, the basics of tools and techniques, an overview of the working fundamentals of building a dish or a meal. Then the book breaks out into chapters on "Condiments, Stocks and Starter Soups," "Rice, Noodles, Dumplings, and Bread," "Vegetables and Herbs," "Fish and Seafood," "Meat and Poultry," and "Sweets and Drinks." She ends her book with notes about Asian food rituals and sample menus and sources. The recipes are refreshingly short, concise, and to the point. A reader could begin by cooking what is already familiar, then expand into the many delicious alternatives <i>Essentials of Asian Cuisine</i> has to offer. Before you know it you'll be swimming like a natural without a second look back. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><b>Corinne Trang</b> is the award-winning author of <i>Authentic Vietnamese Cooking</i> (1999).

The ghosts of the murdered six million, along with the living generation of survivors, have called out the unifying chant, "never again." In 1948, this concern found a second focus in the state of Israel, the ultimate refuge of Jews worldwide. But Rabbi Michael Goldberg finds that these twin pillars of Jewish identity are brittle, and have already begun to crumble; they will not be enough to support or sustain the next generation. The time has come to answer the question: <em>Why</em> should Jews survive?<br> In this provocative book, Goldberg launches a bold attack on what he calls the "Holocaust cult," challenging Jews to return to a deeper, richer sense of purpose. He argues that this cult--with shrines like the U.S. Holocaust Museum, high priests such as Elie Wiesel, and rites like UJA death camp pilgrimages--is deeply destructive of Jewish identity. As the current "master story" of Judaism, Goldberg writes, the Holocaust has been used to depict Jews as uniquely victimized in human history--transforming them from God's chosen to those who manage to survive despite God's silent complicity in their persecution. This Holocaust-centered, survival-for-survival's-sake Judaism is already showing its emptiness, Goldberg contends; the generation that survived Hitler and founded Israel is dying, and the new generation seems adrift (for instance, one recent survey predicts that 70% of American Jewish marriages will be intermarriages by the turn of the century). Jews need <em>positive</em> reasons for remaining Jewish, he argues; they need to return to the Exodus as their master story--the story of God leading the Jews out of slavery and making with them an eternal covenant that gave the Jews a unique place in God's plan. The Jews should survive, Goldberg concludes, because they are the linchpin in God's redemption of the world.<br> Rabbi Michael Goldberg has long wrestled with the crisis of identity facing today's Jewish community. In <em>Why Should Jews Survive?</em>, he provides a provocative and powerfully argued challenge to the dominant theme of modern Jewish thought.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Michael Goldberg</strong> is Rabbi of Congregation <em>B'nai Tikvah</em> in Los Angeles. He was Founding Rabbi of Congregation <em>Lev Chadash</em>, a first-of-its-kind "covenantal" synagogue in Indianapolis, and has held chairs of Jewish Studies at St. John's University (Minnesota) and at the College of William and Mary. He is a founder and principal of Vision Design, a strategic planning consultancy for synagogues and churches, and has served as Special Consultant to the Georgia Supreme Court. His books include <em>Theology and Narrative</em>; <em>Jews and Christians, Getting Our Stories Straight</em>; and <em>Against the Grain: New</em> <em>Approaches to Professional Ethics</em>.<br>The title Goldberg chooses for his denunciation of a mentality of victimization among Jews should cause a stir, but not as much as will his arguments. He asserts that it is important to study the Holocaust, yet he laments that the study has taken on almost religious dimensions. For Goldberg, to portray Jewish history as a long series of suffering, culminating in World War II, is not only inaccurate; it is a "deeply anti-Semitic" assessment of the Jewish people as "spineless." He chastises the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, saying that if its goal "is to spur America's conscience so that it never happens again, so far, it seems, it's been a $167 million bust." He criticizes a militant belief in martyrdom as he compares the Jews' mass suicide in resistance to the Romans at Masada to that of the Jonestown cult. Deeply religious himself, he concludes that the Jews' mission is to carry out God's redemption of the world. These are all provocative ideas. It's about time Judaic studies received such an alarming wake-up call. <i>Aaron Cohen</i></p><h2>French Verbs &amp; Essentials of Grammar, 2E (Verbs and Essentials of Grammar Series)</h2><p><p><b>Your one-stop guide to mastering the basics of French</b></p> <p>Can one book have all you need to communicate confidently in a new language?

Written by Megan Tschannen-Moran&#x2014;an expert on the topic of trust and schools&#x2014;<i>Trust Matters</i> is based in solid research. It outlines the five key elements on which individuals base their trust judgments (benevolence, honesty, openness, reliability, and competency) and explores the factors that influence the development of trust. The book explores the leader&#x2019;s role in fostering high quality relationships among teachers, students, and parents and examines examples of positive outcomes of trusting school environments.</p><p>In this unique book on the critical role of trust in educational leadership, Megan Tschannen-Moran uses a strong research foundation to offer school leaders both insight into the importance of trust and tools to cultivate and maintain trust in their schools. Using three powerful stories of real school principals, Tschannen-Moran reveals the mistakes that well-intended leaders often make&#x2013;mistakes that lead to shattered trust and dysfunctional schools. She provides school leaders with a deeper understanding of what trust is, why it is so significant, and how to build it both within their schools and with the community. Trust Matters combines knowledge and down-to-earth advice which offers school leaders the opportunity to greatly improve the quality of education within their schools. <p>"Megan Tschannen-Moran explains with vivid school examples how crucial the element of trust is to developing successful relations among faculty, staff, students, and parent/community members. Leadership void of trust robs a community of its potential to improve. Leadership with trust brings out the best in all of us.

Barth, author and educational consultant</p>In today&#x2019;s complex and rapidly changing environment, trust is difficult to achieve and maintain. However, trust is an essential element for the smooth functioning of any organization and especially in our schools. School leaders must cultivate trust if they are to fulfill their fundamental mission of educating students to be productive citizens. <p>Trust Matters offers educators a practical, hands-on guide for establishing and maintaining trust within their schools as well as providing information on how to repair trust that has been damaged.

The book explores the leader&#x2019;s role in fostering high quality relationships among teachers, students, and parents and examines examples of positive outcomes of trusting school environments.</p> <p>To clearly illustrate how trust influences the success (or failure) of schools, the author includes three examples of real-life school principals&#x2013;all working in high-poverty urban elementary schools&#x2013;to show how they handled the issue of trust. The successful principal balanced a concern for tasks with a concern for relationships within her school and created an environment that fostered trust. The other two principals failed, one because she was an overzealous reformer who alienated her faculty and the other because he lost the faith of his faculty by avoiding conflict. The lessons learned from these experiences provide a guide for establishing trust in our schools.</p> <p>Each chapter contains a "Putting It into Action" section that offers practical advice for utilizing the book&#x2019;s key suggestions in schools.

This book, which collects aphorisms, essays, stories, and anecdotes, enacts Bloch's interest in showing how attention to "traces"&#x2015;to the marks people make or to natural marks&#x2015;can serve as a mode of philosophizing. In an elegant example of how the literary can become a privileged medium for philosophy, Bloch's chief philosophical invention is to begin with what gives an observer pause&#x2015;what seems strange and astonishing. He then follows such traces into an awareness of the individual's relations to himself or herself and to history, conceived as a thinking into the unknown, the "not yet," and thus as utopian in essence. <i>Traces</i>, a masterwork of twentieth-century philosophy, is the most modest and beautiful proof of Bloch's utopian hermeneutics, taking as its source and its result the simplest, most familiar, and yet most striking stories and anecdotes.</p><p>&#x201c;...this is a literary masterpiece.

This behavior might seem maladaptive&#x2015;after all, every mouthful given to another species is one that you cannot eat&#x2015;but in this heartening new study, acclaimed anthropologist Pat Shipman reveals that our propensity to domesticate and care for other animals is in fact among our species' greatest strengths. For the last 2.6 million years, Shipman explains, humans who coexisted with animals enjoyed definite adaptive and cultural advantages. To illustrate this point, Shipman gives us a tour of the milestones in human civilization-from agriculture to art and even language&#x2015;and describes how we reached each stage through our unique relationship with other animals. <em>The Animal Connection</em> reaffirms our love of animals as something both innate and distinctly human, revealing that the process of domestication not only changed animals but had a resounding impact on us as well. 25 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Pat Shipman is a professor of anthropology at Penn State University. Coauthor of the award-winning The Ape in the Tree and author of The Animal Connection and The Invaders, she writes for American Scientist and lives in Moncure, North Carolina.&#x201c;Pat Shipman gathers together the results of many archaeological studies, and she clearly shows how animals were intimately involved in the development of early humans. Both animal lovers and readers who are interested in human psychology will not be able to put this fascinating book down.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Temple Grandin, author of <i>Animals in Translation</i> and <i>Animals Make Us Human</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Pat Shipman has written one of the most important books on the human-animal connection ever. One might even say it is the single most important book, possibly the only one, to look at our deep connection to animals over the entire evolutionary history of our species. She says that animals are central to the very essence of being human and has proven this to be the case in a work of extraordinarily broad scholarship.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, author of <i>The Dog Who Couldn&#x2019;t Stop Loving</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Eye-opening... a compelling argument and an exciting story. <em>The Animal Connection</em> goes beyond the obvious of what every pet-lover knows. It shows how we evolved and hence how and why we are unique. This is an important book. It&#x2019;s a must-read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bernd Heinrich, author of <i>Winter World</i> and <i>Mind of the Raven</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I read <em>The Animal Connection</em> with great admiration; its data-rich narrative offers profound insights about our species&#x2019; long history with other animals.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Barbara J. King, author of <i>Being with Animals</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Pat Shipman is a respected paleoanthropologist and a superb science writer with an extraordinary reach. Until I read this book, I had not appreciated the significant impact of animals for charting the course of human evolution or the universal importance that animals have today for improving the quality of human life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dean Falk, author of <i>Finding Our Tongues</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Shipman takes us on a journey through human evolution as it has never been told before. She demonstrates that humanity emerged not only through tool use and language, but because of our associations with animals. Shipman&#x2019;s triumph is her demonstration that the modern human condition was borne of our personal connections with animals&#x2015;from horses as transportation, to cows and sheep as food, to dogs as vigilant companions. Our achievements on two legs were made possible by our many relatives on four.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nina G.

Does the problem lie in men's monopoly of technology, or is technology itself in some sense inherently patriarchal? To answer these questions, Judy Wajcman explores what the impact of technology is on the lives of women today.</p><p>Popular stereotypes depict women as technologically incompetent or invisible in technical spheres. Wajcman argues that the identification between men and machines is not immutable but is the result of ideological and cultural processes. She surveys sociological and feminist literature on technology, highlighting the male bias in the way technology is defined as well as developed.</p><p>Over the last two decades feminists have identified men's monopoly on technology as an important source of their power, women's lack of technological skills as an important element in their dependence on men. During this period, women's efforts to control their fertility have extended from abortion and contraception to mobilizing around the new reproductive technologies. At the same time there has been a proliferation of new technologies in the home and in the workplace. The political struggles emerging around reproductive technology, as well as the technologies affecting domestic work, paid labor, and the built environment, are the focus of this book.</p></p><p><i>Feminism Confronts Technology</i> provides a lively and engaging exploration of the impact of technology on women's lives from word processors to food processors, and genetic engineering to the design of cities. Comprehensive and critical, this book surveys the sociological and feminist literature on technology, highlighting the male bias in the way technology is defined as well as developed. Wajcman sets the scene with an overview of feminist theories of science and technology: encompassing the technologies of production and reproduction as well as domestic technology. <p>The author challenges the common assumption that technology is gender neutral, looking at whether technology can liberate women or whether the new technologies are reinforcing sexual divisions in society.</p><p>Judy Wajcman is a Professor at the Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, and a Centennial Professor at the Gender Institute, London School of Economics.

Phillips Payson O&#39;Brien shows us the war in a completely different light. In this compelling new history of the Allied path to victory, he argues that in terms of production, technology and economic power, the war was far more a contest of air and sea than of land supremacy. He shows how the Allies developed a predominance of air and sea power which put unbearable pressure on Germany and Japan&#39;s entire war-fighting machine from Europe and the Mediterranean to the Pacific. Air and sea power dramatically expanded the area of battle and allowed the Allies to destroy over half of the Axis&#39; equipment before it had even reached the traditional &#39;battlefield&#39;. Battles such as El Alamein, Stalingrad and Kursk did not win World War II; air and sea power did.</p><p>This book challenges the view that World War II was decided by land battles. It argues that victory was due to the production and allocation of American and British air and sea weaponry that was used to destroy over half of the Axis&#39;s equipment before it reached the traditional &#39;battlefield&#39;.Phillips Payson O&#39;Brien gained a Ph.D. in History after two years working on Wall Street. Since then, he has published a range of works on British and American strategic and political history during the first half of the twentieth century. More recently, he has taken a leading role as a commentator on defence issues and the debate over Scottish Independence. He has testified in front of UK parliamentary committees, and advised major European governments on the course of the campaign. Through this work he has gained media experience, appearing as a regular commentator for the BBC and STV, and publishing opinion pieces in the Scotsman and the Scottish Herald. He has received awards or research fellowships from the Carnegie Foundation, the US Naval History and Heritage Command, and the Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt Presidential libraries. He has also been invited to Japan twice to speak on World War II at the National Institute of Defence Studies (Tokyo).</p><h2>Introduction to Analysis</h2><p><p> <b>KEY BENEFIT:</b>This new book is written in a conversational, accessible style, offering a great deal of examples.

Being literary gentlemen, they took extensive notes. Five years away from producing his famous dictionary, Samuel Johnson hoped to encounter romantic wilderness scenes by "going where nobody goes and seeing what nobody sees." James Boswell, Johnson's biographer, reveled in the opportunity to visit his native country in the company of his mentor. Their respective accounts of their sojourn offer not only a taste of travel writing at its finest but also fascinating insights into a celebrated literary friendship.<br>At the time of their trip, Johnson was 63, Boswell was 32, and the two had known each other for over a decade. The Scotland they explored on their 83-day journey&#x2014;a rugged territory held down by a string of forts&#x2014;was largely unknown to Europeans. The authors' perceptive observations on the land and its people represent a valuable historical record of a vanished time and place as well as an engaging armchair adventure.</p><p>Johnson&#39;s &#39;Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland&#39; is not only a narrative of personal experience, rare in the canon of his writings, but also a deeply reflective survey of the Highlands and Isles--their social and economic structure, their traditions and customs. Beyond this, Johnson undertakes a subtle, penetrating analysis of a people in the throes of change, and examines the predicament they face as a result.<b>Samuel Johnson</b> (1709 and died in 1784) lived long life, though one marred by depression and fear of death. His literary reputation rests on such a varied output that he defies easy description: poet, critic, lexicographer, travel writer, essayist, editor, and, with his good friend and fellow traveller James Boswell, a biographer.</p><h2>The Practice Absite Question Book</h2><p>From the author of The ABSITE Review.

Public policies...such as those regulating the minimum wage, job availability, tax rates, federal transit, and affordable housing...all create conditions in urban areas that no education policy as currently conceived can transcend. In this first book since her best-selling <em>Ghetto Schooling</em>, Jean Anyon argues that we must replace these federal and metro-area policies with more equitable ones so that urban school reform can have positive life consequences for students.<br>Anyon provides a much-needed new paradigm for understanding and combating educational injustice. Radical Possibilities reminds us that historically, equitable public policies have been typically created as a result of the political pressure brought to bear by social movements. Basing her analysis on new research in civil rights history and social movement theory, Anyon skillfully explains how the current moment offers serious possibilities for the creation of such a force. The book powerfully describes five social movements already under way in U.S. cities, and offers readers interested in building this new social movement a set of practical and theoretical insights into securing economic and educational justice for the many millions of America's poor families and students.</p><p>Radical Possibilities is a powerful and important book. Jean Anyon argues forcefully and persuasively for a new and comprehensive vision to understand and confront the problems of urban education. By showing the limitations of urban school reform in dealing with conditions created by macroeconomic and metropolitan policies, she presents a compelling case for a social movement that centers on education but that addresses the broader issues of social inequality. This well written book is must reading for anyone concerned about the state of urban public schools. <p>William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L.

Several of her articles are classics, and have been reprinted in over 40 edited collections. Her last book,<em></em> <em>Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban School</em> <em>Reform</em>, was reviewed in the <em>Book Review </em>of the <em>New York</em> <em>Times</em>, among many other publications, and is widely used and cited. She teaches social and educational policy in the Doctoral Program in Urban Education at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.</p><h2>A Natural History of California (California Natural History Guides)</h2><p>In this comprehensive and abundantly illustrated book, Allan Schoenherr describes a state with a greater range of landforms, a greater variety of habitats, and more kinds of plants and animals than any area of equivalent size in all of North America. <i>A Natural History of California</i> will familiarize the reader with the climate, rocks, soil, plants and animals in each distinctive region of the state.</p><p>This book includes a description of organisms, rocks, and the environment and an attempt to explain what factors through time created what we see today.

Clark, California Wilderness Coalition</p><h2>Personal Selling: Building Customer Relationships and Partnerships</h2><p>In line with students&#39; current career goals, Personal Selling focuses exclusively on professional business-to-business selling rather than retail selling. Early introduction of the Personal Selling Process (PSP) engages students from the beginning, with tools for converting prospects into customers. The authors&#39; latest research on customer loyalty and relationship marketing further distinguishes Personal Selling from other titles, which focus less on these pressing issues. Strategies for achieving long-term customer loyalty underscore how attracting, cultivating, and retaining satisfied customers leads to higher profitability for salespeople and their organizations. Clear, conversational writing allows students to easily understand the authors&#39; research and analysis of the field. The Second Edition includes an updated discussion of technology tools and services that facilitate sales. Chapter 2 explores the behavioral, technological, and managerial forces affecting personal selling today, and discusses numerous inexorable changes within each.

Finally, one must simply drop the reserve.&#x201d; His paintings of the 1980s and 90s bear this out: their imagery often includes objects and locations in his present studio and home, as well as allusions to memories of his childhood. These motifs are reiterated, altered, reworked and quoted in the context of new compositions, forming layered and complex spaces of recollection that merge past and present. This profusely illustrated volume, published in conjunction with an exhibition of paintings, prints and drawings organized by the Walker Art Center, is the first to look broadly at this period in Johns' career. All of the artist's major bodies of work from the past two decades--including those based on the Seasons, Green Angel and Catenary motifs--are covered in this study, with special consideration given to imagery appropriated from Picasso and Manet. Many of the works are published here for the first time, making this an invaluable tool for the study of Johns' work.</p><p></p><h2>Contemporary Latin American Social and Political Thought: An Anthology (Latin American Perspectives in the Classroom)</h2><p>This anthology offers the first serious, broad-ranging collection of English translations of significant Latin American contributions to social and political thought spanning the last forty years. Iv�n M�rquez has judiciously selected narratives of resistance and liberation; ground-breaking texts in Latin American fields of inquiry such as liberation theology, philosophy, pedagogy, and dependency theory; and important readings in guerrilla revolution, socialist utopia, and post-Cold War thought, especially in the realms of democracy and civil society, alternatives to neoliberalism, and nationalism in the context of globalization. Highlighting the vitality, diversity, and originality of Latin American thought, this anthology will be invaluable for students and scholars across the social sciences and humanities.</p><p>Iv�n M�rquez is associate professor of philosophy at Bentley College.Iv�n M�rquez has gathered in this book a wide range of excerpts from diverse Latin American contributions to social and political thought. He offers to the English-speaking audience of teachers and students a valuable sourcebook of key works by Latin American intellectuals, politicians, and activists. (<i>Hispanic American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Latin America's process of political maturation has left an amazing, rich, and venerable inheritance of political thinking. Iv�n M�rquez has gathered in this wonderful anthology some of the most distinctive and original Latin American political and social thinking. This book is an indispensable resource for teachers and students alike. (Eduardo Mendieta, Professor of Philosophy, Pennsylvania State University)<br><br>M�rquez's book fills a significant gap in the growing literature on social and political thought in Latin America. Instead of retraveling the usual paths of traditional neoliberalism and orthodox Marxism, he has compiled an impressive group of texts from voices seldom heard, and if heard, frequently forgotten. This is an indispensable source for the college curriculum. (Jorge J. E. Gracia, SUNY Buffalo)<br><br>This anthology is a fine sourcebook for crucial political instances within the continent.

But few realize the health consequences they are suffering as a result of modernity's increasingly sedentary lifestyle, or the effects it has had on society at large. In <i>Get Up! </i>, health expert James A. Levine's original scientific research shows that today's chair-based world, where we no longer use our bodies as they evolved to be used, is having negative consequences on our health, and is a leading cause of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Over the decades, humans have moved from a primarily active lifestyle to one that is largely sedentary, and this change has reshaped every facet of our lives&#x2015;from social interaction to classroom design. Levine shows how to throw off the shackles of inertia and reverse these negative trends through simple changes in our daily lives.</p></p><p>James A. Levine is the co-director of the Mayo Clinic/Arizona State University Obesity Solutions Initiative and the inventor of the treadmill desk. He has published more than 100 scientific papers, worked on dozens of corporate programs, and served as an advisor for schools on how to make the classroom a more active place. He was awarded the Invention of the Year Award by NASA, the Platinum Award at the World Fair, and Entrepreneur of the Year in the State of Minnesota. His work has been featured on <i>Rock Center</i>, <i>60 Minutes</i>, BBC, and all major network US morning shows, as well as in <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>The Times of London</i>.According to Levine, codirector of the Mayo Clinic-Arizona State University obesity initiative and inventor of the &#x201c;treadmill desk,&#x201d; for every hour we spend sitting in our chairs, we lose two hours of our lives. In fact, excessive sitting is more dangerous to your health than smoking, Levine insists. He explores the history of the workplace, from the evolution from agrarian to industrial economies, and the dominance of sit-down jobs and leisure that is spreading to developing nations as well. Levine draws on research showing the rise in myriad health issues, from diabetes to cancer to heart disease, that can be traced to a sedentary life style. He goes on to highlight businesses and schools that are working to change their culture to encourage more activity and documenting the benefits in health and greater productivity. At the end of each chapter, Levine challenges readers to test their own levels of chair dependency and devise strategies for unshackling themselves from the chair. Levine mixes fascinating research, levity, and sound advice in a call to action against the modern sedentary life. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Writing for the IELTS (Barron&#39;s Test Prep)</h2><p>Discover everything you&#x2019;ll need to know in order to write well for the IELTS test, whether you are planning to take the Academic or the General Training version.

Based on longtime fieldwork, the book describes the lives of Batek men and women in the tropical rainforest, and includes discussions of fieldwork, hunting and gathering, social organization, religion, gender, nonviolence, and cultural persistence in the face of a changing landscape. Rich in detail yet clearly written, <i>The Headman Was a Woman</i> introduces readers from first-year anthropology students to hunter-gatherer specialists to an egalitarian people whose way of life is both thought-provoking and rare. The text is accompanied by a 37-minute DVD, The Batek: Rainforest Foragers of Kelantan, Malaysia. Footage shows vivid highlights of camp life and social activities as well as all the important economic processes described in the book.

Rebelling equally against the mathematical purity of earlier geometric modernism and what many saw as the emotional excesses of abstract expressionism and Art Informel, these artists emphasized three-dimensionality, the repetition of modular elements, the conceptual underpinnings of art, and the performative to engage the viewer in the creative process and achieve broader intellectual, sensual, and emotive range in their work. <i>Beyond Geometry</i>, which accompanies an exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, showcases over 200 works by 139 artists that chart the development of these experiments in form. It is noteworthy that artists on three continents began exploring these forms at the same time, often unaware of aesthetic developments elsewhere. <i>Beyond Geometry</i> brings together examples of European and Latin American concrete art, Argentine Arte Mad�-Brazilian Neo-Concretism, Kinetic and Op Art, Minimalism, and various forms of post-minimalism including systematic forms of process and conceptual art. These movements and genres developed from a concern with the idea that all meaning resides in the physical object itself, rather than in its metaphorical content or relationship to the outside world.<br> <br> <i>Beyond Geometry</i> includes work by such artists as Josef Albers, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Max Bill, Lucio Fontana, Eva Hesse, On Kawara, Sol LeWitt, Helio Oiticica, Blinky Palermo, Bridget Riley, Jesus Rafael Soto, and Victor Vasarely. It contains essays by Lynn Zelevansky, Ines Katzenstein, Valerie Hillings, Miklos Peternak, Peter Frank, and Brandon LaBelle that place the work in the context of art history and the aesthetic and social issues of the time.</p><p>Lynn Zelevansky is curator and department head, Modern and Contemporary Art, Los Angeles Country Museum of Art.</p><h2>Domestic Animal Behaviour and Welfare [OP]</h2><p>Humans have a natural interest in animals; through a long history of domestication, they have become tools, a food source, and even friends. Behavior is a significant indicator of animal health and well-being, and understanding this behavior is therefore the key to good management. Covering all aspects of animal behavior, including its relation to welfare for companion animals, farm animals, and farmed fish, this book reviews development, socialization, locomotion, reproduction, and more. It takes a comprehensive approach to the subject, featuring a section of chapters addressing common abnormal behaviors and examining some animals, such as rabbits, from both a pet and farm perspective. <br><br>Now in its fifth edition, <i>Domestic Animal Behaviour and Welfare</i> includes new chapters detailing the welfare of sheep, goats, and exotic pets and welfare in relation to genetic selection and modification. Animal behavior and welfare sciences are now core topics for agriculture and veterinary students, with courses and research opportunities in this field growing world-wide. Fully updated and featuring new photographs, this indispensable textbook provides a student-friendly guide to the major themes of animal behavior and welfare.</p><p>Donald&nbsp;M. Broom is Emeritus Professor of Animal Welfare, Cambridge University, Department of Veterinary Medicine. He has developed concepts and methods of scientific assessment of animal welfare and studied: cognitive abilities of animals, the welfare of animals in relation to housing and transport, behavior problems, attitudes to animals, sustainable livestock production and ethics of animal usage. He has published over 300 refereed papers and books including: <i>Stress and Animal Welfare</i> (2000 Springer), <i>The Evolution of Morality and Religion</i> (2003 CUP), <i>Domestic Animal Behaviour and Welfare, 5th edition</i> (2015 CABI), and <i>Sentience and Animal Welfare</i> (2014 CABI).</p><h2>Napoleon at Dresden: The Battles of August 1813</h2><p>Facing the strong and confident armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden, Napoleon had only the bravery of his conscripts and his own fabled mastery of the battlefield to confuse and shatter his opponents. Napoleon inflicted a heavy defeat on the allies at Dresden, only to have it thrown away in the disaster at Kulm, and by his marshals&#39; failures at the battles of the Katzbach, Gross-Beeren, and Dennewitz. Napoleon at Dresden is a panoramic view of the theater of war in Germany over August 1813. Not only covering these five great battles, it also pays close attention to the smaller battles and skirmishes, often critical for the course of the campaign, but many times only the testing ground of a forgotten regiment. The generalship of not only Napoleon is seen, but also that of his lieutenants, such as the famed Ney and the forceful Vandamme, as well as his opponents, the coalition manager Schwarzenberg, the turncoat Bernadotte, and the aggressive Blucher. August 1813 was the most active month of campaigning of the Napoleonic wars. Prepared from hundreds of sources, this is the most thorough study of the Dresden campaign ever written. You can now study and understand the repercussions of these fateful battles with Napoleon at Dresden.</p><p></p><h2>Insurance Risk and Ruin (International Series on Actuarial Science)</h2><p>The focus of this book is on the two major areas of risk theory: aggregate claims distributions and ruin theory. For aggregate claims distributions, detailed descriptions are given of recursive techniques that can be used in the individual and collective risk models. For the collective model, the book discusses different classes of counting distribution, and presents recursion schemes for probability functions and moments. For the individual model, the book illustrates the three most commonly applied techniques. Beyond the classical topics in ruin theory, this new edition features an expanded section covering time of ruin problems, Gerber-Shiu functions, and the application of De Vylder approximations. Suitable for a first course in insurance risk theory and extensively classroom tested, the book is accessible to readers with a solid understanding of basic probability. Numerous worked examples are included and each chapter concludes with exercises for which complete solutions are provided.</p><p>Designed as a first course in insurance risk theory for readers with a solid understanding of basic probability, this book develops the two major areas of risk theory: aggregate claims distributions and ruin theory.

Some are vastly more profitable than others, and the marketers who succeed in an increasingly brand-hostile and technology-driven environment will be those who know how to capitalize on the difference.<br> <br> Differential Marketing is a revolutionary new approach that separates the golden eggs from the goose eggs. It uses cutting-edge but practical technology and practices to build old-fashioned brand loyalty--and old-fashioned profits--by communicating more directly and persuasively with the brand's most valuable customers. And it does so across all disciplines--advertising, sales promotion, and direct marketing.<br> <br> Developed at one of the world's leading marketing communications agencies, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, and proven in the marketplace by clients like Kraft, Unilever, Kimberly-Clark, and Seagram, this breakthrough approach to building stronger brands turns conventional marketing wisdom inside out:<br> <br> True or False? Most of the profits of many brands--even big brands--come from less than ten percent of all households.<br> <br> True or False? A brand's most valuable customers give more of their business to the competition than they do to the brand.<br> <br> True or False? The overwhelming majority of brand volume comes from consumers who don't count or don't care.<br> <br> All are true. And what they add up to is the need for a radical alternative to current mass market communication methods. Differential Marketing is an overarching concept that combines the power of consumer databases, integrated marketing, and one-to-one relationship building to produce double-digit sales increases from high-profit customers.<br> <br> In All Consumers Are Not Created Equal, author Garth Hallberg provides the inside perspective on what makes Differential Marketing so effective. Best of all, he not only serves up a powerful new vision, but also offers practical advice about how to put it to work to build a healthier, more profitable brand.<br> <br> In the iconoclastic tradition of David Ogilvy, a radical alternative to current mass market communications<br> <br> Finally, a new approach to building brand loyalty that gives marketers a competitive edge in today's high-tech, high-stakes, brand-hostile environment.

Musicologist Dorothy Lamb Crawford looks closely at the lives, creative work, and influence of sixteen performers, fourteen composers, and one opera stage director, who joined this immense migration beginning in the 1930s. Some in this group were famous when they fled Europe, others would gain recognition in the young musical culture of Los Angeles, and still others struggled to establish themselves in an environment often resistant to musical innovation. </p><p>Emphasizing individual voices, Crawford presents short portraits of Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and the other musicians while also considering their influence as a group&#x2014;in the film industry, in music institutions in and around Los Angeles, and as teachers who trained the next generation. The book reveals a uniquely vibrant era when Southern California became a hub of unprecedented musical talent.</p></p><p><b>Dorothy Lamb Crawford</b> has lived and worked in music throughout her career, teaching and lecturing, performing as a singer, directing opera, and hosting broadcast interviews with musicians.

Derived from a series of lectures delivered by Charles Howard McIlwain at Cornell University in the 1938&#x2013;39 academic year, these lectures provide a useful introduction to the development of modern constitutional forms.</p> <p><strong>Charles Howard McIlwain</strong> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1924 for his constitutional analysis of the American Revolution.</p></p><p>Charles Howard McIlwain [1871-1968] was one of the twentieth century&#39;s most distinguished scholars of Anglo-American constitutional history. He was the Eaton Professor of the Science of Government in Harvard University and the author of The High Court of Parliament and Its Supremacy (1910) and The American Revolution: A Constitutional Interpretation (1924).The time seems to be propitious for an examination of the general principle of constitutionalism - our own Anglo-Saxon brand of it in particular - and an examination which should include some consideration of the successive stages in its development. For perhaps never in its long history has the principle of constitutionalism been so questioned as it is questioned today, never has the attack upon it been so determined or so threatening as it is just now. The world is trembling in the balance between the orderly procedure of law and the processes of force which seem so much more quick and effective. We must make our choice between these two, and it must be made in the very near future. If we are to make that choice intelligently it would seem reasonable whether in the end we decide for law or for force, that we should retrace the history of our constitutionalism - the history of force is enough - should try to estimate its past achievement, and should consider the nature and effects of the forces which have been arrayed against it . . . . Readers interested in Anglo-American history, political philosophy, or simply the foundation for individual liberty will appreciate the republication of this classic work.<br><br><b><i>Educational Book Review India</i></b><br>June-July 2008</p><h2>Edward S.

Curtis took thousands of photographs of Native Americans all over the West and his assistants collected masses of other data - myths, recordings of music and ceremonies, folk tales, language vocabularies, and histories. This material was published in The North American Indian (1907-30), in twenty volumes of illustrated text and twenty portfolios of photographs; the project was supported by Theodore Roosevelt and funded in part by J.

Stedman's Medical Terminology:&nbsp;Steps to Success in Medical Language is a mid-level medical terminology text perfect for instructors looking for minimal coverage of anatomy and physiology and plenty of hands-on exercises to reinforce learning. Each chapter alternates between term presentation and exercises to ensure that students can apply what they have learned immediately.Throughout the text, exercises progress in a meaningful way, from recall and review, to word building, to comprehension, and finally to application and analysis through the use of "real-world" case study and medical record exercises. This approach allows the student to actively see their knowledge building and to connect what they are learning to real-life context. A robust, realistic, and relevant art program enhances the text, especially for visual learners.A full suite of ancillaries, including videos and animations,&nbsp;is available</p><p>, David Peruski, Delta College -- &#34;I like the various methods to help the students learn the words and definitions. I like the exam questions - they make you apply clinical information.&#34; , Marcia Morse, Davenport University -- &#34;Illustrations are great to help drive the concepts home. The exercises are organized, flow well, and make the students apply their knowledge. They must read it, write it, then process it, and write it again at the end of the chapter.&#34; , Rebecca Giuliante, Our Lady of the Lake Health Career Institute -- &#34;The approach creates an atmosphere to where the student will experience the context in which the medical term is used. This is a much better approach to learning medical terminology rather than rote memory? The writing style is at a level that the text could be used as a self-teaching text which would be excellent for hybrid or online courses.&#34;</p><h2>When Life&#39;s Not Working: 7 Simple Choices for a Better Tomorrow</h2><p>Life is hard--for everyone.

Nurture Customer Loyalty and Drive Growth</h2><p><b>An industry expert shows readers how to get the best return on investment from corporate events</b> <p>Corporate events and business entertaining are a major part of a company's communication, marketing and public relations strategy. They are used by businesses of all sizes to solicit new business, create a corporate or brand image, and retain and build loyalty with existing suppliers and customers. They can also be used effectively to elicit peak performance from employees and produce camaraderie and teamwork among co-workers. The corporate event bar has been raised dramatically and the competition to craft something original that will help a business create public awareness as well as industry and media buzz is fierce.</p> <p>Staged effectively, business functions can contribute to a company's success, standing, profitability and business development. But corporate events and business entertaining can also seriously damage a company's image and put the company and its management in potentially high-risk situations if not handled carefully, professionally, and appropriately.

This question, which is at the heart of recent debates in the US over federal funding of private schools, forms the core of this book. The problem of political education is to ensure the constitutive ideals of liberal democracy while remaining open to a diversity of conduct and beliefs that may threaten those ideals. In <em>Creating Citizens</em>, Eamonn Callan, one of the world's foremost philosophers of education, identifies both the principal ends of civic education and the rights that limit their political pursuit. This timely new study sheds light on some of our most divisive educational controversies, such as state sponsorship and regulation of denominational schooling, as well as the role of non-denominational schools in the moral and political development of children.<br></p><p><br>Professor Eamonn Callan is Professor of Educational Policy Studies aty the University of Alberta, Canada. He was educated at University College, Dublin and at the University of Alberta, where he gained his Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Education in 1982. He is the author of numerous articles and books on the philosophy of education and educational policy.<br><br>"This is a very good book. It is beautifully written; it contains an original interpretation of certain aspects of liberal political philosophy; and it applies some of these insights to the pressing issue of the kind of education that is appropriate for liberal citizenship...Callan is to be commended for applying a sophisticated liberal political philosophy to the difficult and neglected issues of citizenship education. He demonstrates that philosophy is capable of advancing our thinking in these areas, and generating a principled on these very thorny issues. Even when readers disagree with Callan's conclusions, they will benefit from engaging with his argument and analysis."--<em>The Review of Politics</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Pricing Convertible Bonds</h2><p>The Convertible Bonds (CB) market is growing all the time.

Since his retirement, he has earned a reputation as an equally uncompromising commentator, never afraid to tell it as he sees it and lash out at the money men and professionals that have made rugby into such a different beast. Yet, for all his bullishness on and off the pitch, there also appears a more unconventional, complicated side to the man. A solicitor by trade, Moore's love of fine wine, career experience as a manicurist, and preference for reading Shakespeare in the dressing room before games, mark him out as anything but the stereotypical rugby player, and in <i>Beware of the Dog</i>, Moore lays open with astounding frankness the shocking events, both personal and professional, that have gone towards shaping him over the years.

As a cook and domestic servant at Louisiana's Melrose Plantation, she painted on hundreds of objects available around her -- glass snuff bottles, discarded roofing shingles, ironing boards -- as well as on canvas. She produced between five and ten thousand paintings, including her most ambitious work, the African House Murals. Scenes of cotton planting and harvesting, washdays, weddings, baptisms, funerals, Saturday night revelry, and zinnias depict experiences of everyday plantation life along the Cane River. More than a personal record of Hunter's life, her paintings also reflect the social, material, and cultural aspects of the area's larger African American community. Drawing on archival research, interviews, personal files, and a close relationship with the artist, Art Shiver and Tom Whitehead offer the first comprehensive biography of this self-taught painter, who attracted the attention of the world. Shiver and Whitehead trace Hunter's childhood, her encounters at Melrose with artists and writers, such as Alberta Kinsey and Lyle Saxon, and the role played by eccentric Fran�ois Mignon, who encouraged and promoted her art. The authors include rare paintings and photographs to illustrate Hunter's creative process and discuss the evolution of her style. The book also highlights Hunter's impact on the modern art world and provides insight into a decades-long forgery operation that Tom Whitehead helped uncover. This recent attention reinforced the uniqueness of Hunter's art and confirmed her place in the international art community, which continues to be inspired by the life and work of Clementine Hunter.</p></p><p><p>Art Shiver was introduced to Clementine Hunter by Tom Whitehead in the early 1970s. Following a career in television broadcast news and station management, he continues to write on subjects ranging from poetry to technology.</p><p>Tom Whitehead knew Clementine Hunter personally and has written and spoken widely on the artist. He and Art Shiver coedited Clementine Hunter: The African House Murals. A professor emeritus of journalism at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana, he now serves that university's president as a consultant on special projects.</p>''This is a clear-eyed account of Clementine Hunter's extraordinary journey from plantation cotton picker to nationally recognized folk painter and muralist. Shiver and Whitehead have tirelessly researched their subject and peeled away the thick web of legends and fictions that have spun around the artist in the past. They tell us many new things about the people who helped Hunter along the way and some of them make up a rogue's gallery: zealous do-gooders, clever imposters, and outright forgers. Good illustrations and a full bibliography top off this marvelous study.'' --Wanda M. Corn, author of <i>Seeing Gertrude Stein: Five Stories</i><br><br>''I consider myself indeed fortunate to have met Clementine Hunter as she sat at her easel painting on the grounds of the plantation where she had been born, grew up, and raised her children. Artists are indeed born and Clementine Hunter had a God-given gift to be able to translate the world around her onto canvas or planks. She gave a glimpse of her world to all of us and to generations to come. This book helps ensure her work and story of life reaches far into the future.'' --Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, former congresswoman<br><br>''For Clementine Hunter's legions of admirers, this book is cause for celebration. For those who require an introduction to her life and work, it's an invitation to discover a great American artist who somehow left the fields and the kitchen of the plantation where she worked and landed in the world's best museums.

Others are more difficult. And then there are situations that seem completely hopeless. Conflict is escalating, people are getting aggressive, and no one is willing to back down. And to top it off, you have little power or other resources to work with. Harvard professor and negotiation adviser Deepak Malhotra shows how to defuse even the most potentially explosive situations and to find success when things seem impossible. Malhotra identifies three broad approaches for breaking deadlocks and resolving conflicts, and draws out scores of actionable lessons using behind-the-scenes stories of fascinating real-life negotiations, including drafting of the US Constitution, resolving the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending bitter disputes in the NFL and NHL, and beating the odds in complex business situations. But he also shows how these same principles and tactics can be applied in everyday life, whether you are making corporate deals, negotiating job offers, resolving business disputes, tackling obstacles in personal relationships, or even negotiating with children. As Malhotra reminds us, regardless of the context or which issues are on the table, negotiation is always, fundamentally, about human interaction. No matter how high the stakes or how protracted the dispute, the object of negotiation is to engage with other human beings in a way that leads to better understandings and agreements. The principles and strategies in this book will help you do this more effectively in every situation.<br><br>Winner of the International Association of Conflict Management Outstanding Book Award.</p><p><b>Deepak Malhotra</b> is the Eli Goldston Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.

Such attempts are difficult not only because the issues at stake may be contentious or complex, but because, often, neither side wants to make the first move. The side that comes asking for peace may look weak rather than wise or magnanimous, a signal that no leader can afford to send. And yet, a deal was reached. Despite having been drafted thousands of years ago, the treaty has many of the hallmarks of more recent agreements, including provisions proclaiming the end to conflict, the repatriation of refugees, an exchange of prisoners, and a mutual assistance pact if either side were to be attacked by others.1<br><br> One other characteristic makes this accord similar to what we often see today&#x2014;in peace treaties, commercial agreements, and successful efforts at resolving conflicts ranging from international disputes to arguments between spouses. This feature is apparent in the Treaty of Kadesh only because it was recorded in two languages: hieroglyphics (the Egyptian translation) and Akkadian (the Hittite translation). A comparison of the translations reveals that the two versions are, as we ought to expect, very similar. But there is at least one important difference. The Egyptian translation states that it was the Hittites who came asking for peace terms. The Hittite version claims exactly the opposite.<br><br> When it comes to deal making, diplomacy, and resolving disputes, it does not matter which culture you examine or what kind of negotiation you investigate. It does not matter why people were fighting or why they chose to settle their differences. Some things never change: the need for all sides to declare victory is at least as old as recorded history itself.<br><br> The Treaty of Kadesh also exposes a more fundamental insight about negotiation and peacemaking&#x2014;one that lays the foundation for this book:<br><br> Even seemingly impossible deadlocks and conflicts can be resolved if we shed the assumption that our only sources of leverage are money and muscle.<br><br> This is especially important to keep in mind when you are dealing with a situation that seems hopeless. When even your most generous offers are being rejected, when your well-intentioned attempts at addressing the issues are being thwarted, and when you have little power with which to impose a solution, you need a different approach and other sources of leverage. This book provides such an approach and reveals those sources of leverage.<br><br> THREE WAYS TO NEGOTIATE THE IMPOSSIBLE<br><br> Some negotiations are easy. Others are more difficult. And then there are situations that seem downright impossible. These are ones in which you have little power and limited options. These are times when conflict is escalating, deadlock is worsening, and no one is willing to back down. These are situations where people are behaving in ways that seem irrational&#x2014;or worse, with clearly hostile intent. These are problems without precedent, where even vast experience offers limited guidance.<br><br> But these are also the cases that, when handled skillfully, will become the stuff of legend.<br> This book is about such negotiations: deadlocked deals and ugly disputes that seemed completely hopeless. Until, that is, someone found a way to beat the odds without money or muscle. What might we learn from these stories and from those who lived them?<br><br> As anyone who has dealt with deadlock or conflict will attest, some of the hardest situations to resolve are those where your attempts at negotiating in good faith have failed and where you don&#x2019;t have the resources or power to bargain effectively. The reason people lose hope and begin to see the situation as impossible is that they have already tried their best to address the substance of the dispute&#x2014;they simply have no more money or muscle left. But what if there were other levers you could use?<br><br> In this book, we will focus on three crucial levers that negotiators often ignore, underestimate, or mismanage, especially when they are accustomed to thinking of power in terms of money and muscle:<br><br> � The Power of Framing<br> � The Power of Process<br> � The Power of Empathy<br><br> In my teaching and advisory work with thousands of business executives and company owners, I have heard countless tales of deal makers who were negotiating against the odds. In my work for governments and policy makers who are trying to negotiate with terrorists and armed insurgents, I have many times encountered the feeling of despair that comes from tackling the seemingly impossible. And, in my observations of even ordinary conflicts of everyday life, I have seen people struggle with how to manage hostile people, difficult situations, and thorny issues. In all of these places, people sometimes make a bad situation worse&#x2014;or a difficult problem seem impossible&#x2014;by pinning their hopes on money and muscle and failing to appreciate the power of framing, process, and empathy.<br><br> What insights might we share with people who are dealing with nasty conflicts in business, policy, diplomacy, or everyday life? What lessons might they learn from the most harrowing case of nuclear brinkmanship in world history? How might they emulate a young man of little clout or stature who managed to dominate one of the most important meetings of the last millennium? What might they take from the text of the most ancient peace treaty known to be in existence? What principles might they glean from comparing multibillion-dollar sports conflicts that were handled masterfully with those that ended in disaster? And what strategies might they borrow from a wide variety of high-stakes business disputes and deadlocks that were overcome without flexing muscle or throwing money at the problem?<br><br> The premise of the book is simple: there is much to be learned from situations in which people negotiated the &#x201c;impossible.&#x201d; First, the stories themselves&#x2014;from history, diplomacy, business, sports, and popular culture&#x2014;are inherently interesting, and readers will learn about how people lived and fought and negotiated in times and places both near and distant from where we sit today. Second, the stories offer tangible lessons that can be applied by anyone who is dealing with his or her own conflict or deadlock, whether it is seemingly impossible or more ordinary. Throughout, I give examples of how the lessons could be applied in other domains&#x2014;ranging from job offers, to business deals, to personal relationships, to negotiating with your children, to engaging with terrorists. Finally, if we were to strip this book of all its trappings, frameworks, and organizational structure, we would find that it is, at the core, a book about human beings trying their best to get along with each other in situations that are not always easy. My hope is that the book instills optimism and provides another lens through which the reader can begin to appreciate the sometimes puzzling, occasionally disappointing or even exasperating, yet often inspiring thing we call humanity.<br><br> RETHINKING &#x201c;NEGOTIATION&#x201d;<br><br> Before going any further, I will define negotiation as it is used in this book. In my experience, it is possible to think too narrowly about what negotiation is, what it entails, and when it is relevant&#x2014;whereas I mean to use the word in its broadest possible sense. Too often, when people hear the word &#x201c;negotiation,&#x201d; they equate it with haggling or debating, or imagine people in suits hammering out a deal. They think of negotiation as something we do once in a while&#x2014;or worse, as a daunting or unpleasant task that should be avoided if possible. We would benefit from thinking differently.<br><br> Having advised on multibillion-dollar deals, I can say with confidence that negotiation is not about dollars and cents. Having advised on how heads of state might manage peace processes that are on the verge of collapse, I can tell you that negotiation is not about lives lost or lives saved. Having advised on job negotiations and family disputes and strategic partnerships and cease-fires, I can assure you that negotiation is not about career trajectory, or managing emotions, or finding synergies, or stopping bullets.<br><br> In short, negotiation is not about any one currency. Negotiation, regardless of the context or the issues involved, is fundamentally about human interaction. However simple or complex the issues, however well-intentioned or malicious the parties, however familiar or unprecedented the challenges, the question we are always trying to answer in negotiation is this: How might we engage with other human beings in a way that leads to better understandings and agreements? It does not matter whether the agreement is to be written down, as in a contract or treaty, or whether its enforcement is to be trusted to newly established goodwill, redesigned incentives, improved coordination, or merely the hope that accompanies a shaking of hands. It does not matter whether the understanding is between individuals or organizations, ethnic groups or countries. Negotiation is always, fundamentally, about human interaction. Sometimes these interactions are easy. Other times, they are tougher. And then, of course, there are the negotiations that interest us most in this book&#x2014;the seemingly impossible ones.<br><br> Negotiation, then, is the process by which two or more parties who perceive a difference in interests or perspective attempt to reach agreement. <br><br> The principles, strategies, and tactics that help us do so in extremely difficult situations are the focus of this book.<br><br> Deadlock and ugly conflicts<br><br> The book includes dozens of stories from many different contexts.3 In selecting the examples, I have focused on the kinds of problems that people often admit to facing in their own lives: deadlocks and ugly conflicts. Deadlock is a situation where people are making incompatible demands and neither side is willing to back down. We will look at situations where the deadlock is so severe that it threatens the entire deal or relationship, but we will also tie the lessons back to less extreme situations. A conflict is any situation in which people have competing interests or divergent perspectives. Ugly conflicts are those in which people are facing formidable obstacles to achieving agreement&#x2014;for example, mistrust, animosity, complexity, or a protracted history of hostility. We will see examples of each of these throughout the book as we extract lessons for managing conflicts of all kinds.<br><br> HOW THE BOOK IS ORGANIZED<br><br> The stories and lessons in this book are organized across three sections, each emphasizing and exploring one of the three levers: framing, process, and empathy. Which one of these levers will be the key to solving your problem&#x2014;or, whether you will need to use multiple levers&#x2014;will depend on the situation. Alone, each of these is extremely effective. Together, they provide a comprehensive approach to negotiating the impossible.<br><br> � Part I focuses on the amazing potential of framing. Effective negotiators know that how you articulate or structure your proposals can be as important as what you are proposing.<br><br> � Part II focuses on the decisive role of process in determining outcomes. Negotiating the process astutely can be more important than bargaining hard on the substance of the deal.<br><br> � Part III focuses on the tremendous power of empathy. A dispassionate and methodical approach to understanding the real interests and perspective of all relevant players can help to resolve even the ugliest of conflicts.4<br><br> Of course, not all problems of human interaction will be solved quickly or easily. Many of the worst conflicts require tremendous effort, strategic perseverance, and fortuitous timing. But there are also times when what is most needed is something a bit different: the ability to control the frame, to shape the process, and to unearth possibilities where others see none.<br><br> With that&#x2014;I hope you enjoy the stories. I hope you find the lessons to be of value. And I hope the book encourages you to see every problem of human interaction as an opportunity for achieving greater understanding and better agreements.</p><h2>Citizen-Protectors: The Everyday Politics of Guns in an Age of Decline</h2><p>From gang- and drug-related shootings to mass shootings in schools, shopping centers, and movie theatres, reports of gun crimes fill the headlines of newspapers and nightly news programs. At the same time, a different kind of headline has captured public attention: a steady surge in pro-gun sentiment among Americans. In <em>Citizen-Protectors</em>, Jennifer Carlson offers a compelling portrait of gun carriers, shedding light on Americans' complex relationship with guns. Delving headlong into the world of guns, Carlson participated in firearms training classes, attending pro-gun events, and carried a firearm herself. Through these experiences, she explores the role guns play in the lives of Americans who carry them and shows how, against a backdrop of economic insecurity and social instability, gun carrying becomes a means of being a good citizen. A much-needed counterpoint to the rhetorical battles over gun control, <em>Citizen-Protectors</em> is a captivating and revealing look at gun culture in America, and a must-read for anyone with a stake in this heated debate.<br></p><p><br>Jennifer Carlson is Assistant Professor, School of Sociology and School of Government &amp; Public Policy at the University of Arizona. Her work examines gun politics, policing and public law enforcement, the politics of race and gender, and violence.<br><br>"In this insightful, often eye-popping study, Jennifer Carlson describes how millions of Americans have come to view carrying of concealed guns in public as a civic obligation - and to regard killing in self-defense as a moral act. Whether you embrace these views or find them repugnant, the study will force you to grapple with uncomfortable questions about the role of the state vs. the individual in maintaining public order." --Kristin A. Goss, Duke University, and co-author of <em>The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know�</em><p></p><br>"Carlson's study is the first to take gun carriers seriously as social subjects, a breakthrough in our national discussion of guns, law, and society." --Jonathan Simon, University of California, Berkeley<p></p><br>"In this riveting and reflexive ethnography, Jennifer Carlson locks, loads, and fires a nuanced argument about how guns are used to address problems of social, economic, and physical insecurities in the United States. The findings compel the reader to reflect on the ubiquitous and embodied American culture of self-reliance, racialized criminalization, and vigilantism." --Victor Rios, University of California, Santa Barbara and author of <em>Punished</em><p></p><br>"... a timely, well-written, jargon-free, nuanced book on why millions of Americans carry guns and view themselves as models of good citizenship... Gun supporters and gun opponents will be challenged by this sophisticated work." --<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"I recommend this book. Carlson serves to enhance this body of literature, pursuing the menacing and challenging questions central to the most relevant concerns and social issues today. This book is not just for academics. Anyone with a general interest in gun culture and related debates should find this book to be of value. It's a worthwhile read." --Jim D. Taylor, Ohio University Zanesville, <em>American Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"<em>Citizen-Protectors</em> is a well-researched book that takes gun-carriers as important social subjects in the gun-related debate. Jennifer Carlson is not politically correct and does not hesitate to ask and try to answer difficult questions. And she does it in a timely, nuanced and easy-to-understand manner. This book is for every American." --<em>The Washington Bookreview</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Citizen-Protectors</em>, Jennifer Carlson explores Americans' love for firearms. During her research for this book, Jennifer Carlson took part in firearms training sessions, attended pro-arm gatherings, and carried a gun herself. With the help of the stories of gun-carriers, Jennifer Carlson opens a window into the complexities of American gun culture and the dramatic changes it has undergone over the past several decades." - The Washington Book Review <br><p></p><br></p><h2>A Primer of Freudian Psychology</h2><p>Culled from forty years of writing by the founder of psychoanalysis, <b>A Primer Of Freudian Psychology</b> introduces Freud's theories on the dynamics and development of the human mind.

Kids will want to get their hands on this shiny, metallic, oversize volume. There are more categories than ever, including "most underpants pulled on in one minute!" But there are serious topics as well and lots of spotlights and photos of people who unleash their "inner superheroes." A chapter honors imaginary superheroes, while another section recognizes real "superhumans." The book lets readers know that they, too, can be the best in whatever they attempt, be it strength, endurance, intelligence, or persistence. There are copious records devoted to sports, transportation, animals, and music and pop culture. Preteens will likely be excited to learn about the highest-earning celebrities. And don't miss the eating records, such as the fastest time to drink a bottle of ketchup (32.37 seconds).

Now this age is coming to a close. As a result there is a deep unease. We are lost both as individuals, and as a culture. In the new relativistic, post-modern era, we have no history, no right or moral action, and no body of knowledge. In their place is a plethora of alternative, and sometimes incompatible theories from 'fuzzy logic' to 'consilience' proposing a theory of everything. <em>Closure</em> is a response to this crisis. It is a radically new story about the nature of ourselves and of the world.<br><em>Closure</em> exposes the central questions of contemporary philosophy: language and meaning, of the individual and identity, of truth and reality, but it is also philosophical in the broader everyday sense that it enables us to make sense of where and who we are. A central principle, the process of closure, is shown to be at the heart of experience and language. As a theory of knowledge it has dramatic consequences for our understanding of the sciences, involving a reinterpretation of what science does and how it is able to do it. It similarly proposes a profound shift in the role of art and religion. But, above all, it reshapes our understanding of ourselves and the organisation of society, our goals and our capacity to achieve them.<br>A superb new account of how order is created out of disorder, <em>Closure</em> is an exhilarating work of conceptual geography.</p><p>Hilary Lawson runs TVF, a major TV production company which produces documentaries and shows for Channel 4 and the BBC.

This was not the full play-text; it was not the public performance. It was the actor's part, consisting of the bare cues and speeches of each individual role. With group rehearsals rare or non-existent, the cued part alone had to furnish the actor with his character. But each such part-text was riddled with gaps and uncertainties. The actor knew what he was going to say, but not necessarily when, or why, or to whom; he may have known next to nothing of any other part. It demanded the most sensitive attention to the opportunities inscribed in the script, and to the ongoing dramatic moment. Here is where the young actor Shakespeare learnt his trade; here is where his imagination, verbal and technical, learnt to roam. <br><br>This is the story of <em>Shakespeare in Parts.</em> As Shakespeare developed his playwriting, the apparent limitations of the medium get transformed into expressive opportunities. Both cue and speech become promise-crammed repositories of meaning and movement, and of individually discoverable space and time. Writing always for the same core group of players, Shakespeare could take - and insist upon - unprecedented risks. The result is onstage drama of astonishing immediacy. <br><br>Starting with a comprehensive history of the part in early modern theatre, Simon Palfrey and Tiffany Stern's mould-altering work of historical and imaginative recovery provides a unique keyhole onto hitherto forgotten practices and techniques. It not only discovers a newly active, choice-ridden actor, but a new Shakespeare.<br></p><p><br> Tiffany Stern is a Lecturer in English Literature at Oxford University, and the Beaverbrook and Bouverie Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at University College, Oxford. She specialises in Shakespeare, theatre history from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, book history, and editing.

Although focused on literary translation from theoretical, descriptive and historical perspectives, it presents a conceptualization of a general theory, addressing a number of issues discussed today. The &#x2018;practical&#x2019; mission of the book as a theory extending to practice is based on the same historical-dialectic affinity of methods, norms, functions and values, accounting for the translator&#x2019;s agency and other contextual agents involved in the communication process.

For the first time in Spain, France, England and Germany the luxury of thinking and learning ceased to be the limited preserve of the higher echelons of the Church and the Court. The effect, the author shows, was to bring about an irreversible shift in European culture.<br> This intellectual history of medieval Europe (translated from the revised French edition of 1984) will be widely welcomed by students and scholars of the Middle Ages throughout the English-speaking world.</p><p><b>Jacques Le Goff</b> is one of France's most well known and respected historians.

Donald Miller, himself an accomplished historian, amplifies Commager's work with this substantially revised edition.<p> Drawing on oral histories and on the vast body of literature that followed the original edition, Miller writes vividly of the key events that shaped the progress of the war, from Dunkirk to the surrender of the Japanese government aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. Along the way, he examines the war as it played out on many fronts, incorporating the memories of women defense workers, German and Japanese combat veterans, and the ordinary Allied soldiers whom correspondent Ernie Pyle called "doggies." The text is thoroughly illustrated with period photographs, maps, and sidebars, adding both to its immediacy and its usefulness as a reference work.</p><p> Concentrating on the war through American eyes, Miller and Commager's book is far from definitive. Even so, it makes an important addition to the growing library of work devoted to the era, and readers with an interest in World War II will learn much from its pages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Donald L.

Written from the perspective of a theatrical lighting designer, it discusses how to see color, how to construct effective lighting palettes, and how to make use of both color filters and color-mixing LED fixtures to create compositions that work well with scenery and costumes to tell compelling stories. We are presently at the leading edge of a revolution in theatrical lighting, redefining how it can be used to create and communicate. Today s LED-based additive color-mixing fixtures require new methodologies and new ways of thinking, and Color &amp; Light directly addresses this technology s potentials and challenges. But underpinning lighting s many recent technological changes is the fundamental language of color that artists have worked with since the birth of humanity s artistic urges. More saturated vs. less, warmer vs. cooler, more green vs. more magenta, recessive vs. dominant the bedrock language of color manipulation endures, whether you are putting paintbrush to canvas or calling up color attributes on a high-tech lighting console. Balancing the basics and the latest innovations, Color &amp; Light is a book for everyone involved artistically with light and color. It will enhance your understanding of how a lighting setup works from a color perspective, while equipping you with the language to communicate about color with your collaborators.</p><p>Clifton Taylor has created designs for theater, dance, and opera companies on Broadway, regionally across the United States, and in 17 countries around the world.

A master of comic timing and an innovative producer, Benny, with his radio writers, developed a weekly situation comedy to meet radio&#x2019;s endless need for new material, at the same time integrating advertising into the show&#x2019;s humor. Through the character of the vain, cheap everyman, Benny created a fall guy, whose frustrated struggles with his employees addressed midcentury America&#x2019;s concerns with race, gender, commercialism, and sexual identity. Kathryn H. Fuller-Seeley contextualizes her analysis of Jack Benny and his entourage with thoughtful insight into the intersections of competing entertainment industries and provides plenty of evidence that transmedia stardom, branded entertainment, and virality are not new phenomena but current iterations of key aspects in American commercial cultural history.</p><p>"Jack Benny built his career on letting his second bananas cut him down to size, but media scholar Kathryn Fuller-Seeley knows a giant of twentieth-century entertainment when she sees&#x2014;and hears&#x2014;one. A meticulous researcher, sensitive critic, and unabashed fan, Fuller-Seeley examines the sonic wraparound and cultural reverberations of Benny&#x2019;s comic art and discovers an atmosphere thick with the buzz of ethnic, racial, and gendered static&#x2014;not to mention some seriously funny gags, wisecracks, voices, and sound effects. Like its subject, <i>Jack Benny and the Golden Age of American Radio Comedy</i> is tone-perfect and a delight to dial in to."&#x2014;Thomas Doherty, Brandeis University<br><br> "At last, Jack Benny gets the treatment he deserves! This lively, wonderfully detailed and meticulously researched study of Benny's contributions to twentieth-century arts and culture will delight not only those who remember him but those who have yet to discover this icon of American comedy."&#x2014;Michele Hilmes, Professor Emerita, University of Wisconsin-Madison<br><br> "When we think of Jack Benny, his real-life wife Mary Livingstone and his radio valet played by Eddie Anderson also come to mind. Now we have another perfect pairing, the great Benny with one of our finest cultural historians. Kathryn Fuller-Seeley examines a life and career in entertainment as well as the half-century, cross-media popularity of Benny&#x2019;s particular form of Jewish masculinity."&#x2014;Eric Smoodin, author of <i>Regarding Frank Capra: Audience, Celebrity, and American Film Studies, 1930-1960</i><b>Kathryn H.

The wealth of his writings, both published and unpublished, that constitute his intellectual legacy are now preserved in this authoritative, chronologically arranged, multi-volume edition. Faithfully reproducing the texts of his letters, speeches, sermons, student papers, and articles, this edition has no equal.<br><br>Volume One contains many previously unpublished documents beginning with the letters King wrote to his mother and father during his childhood. We read firsthand his surprise and delight in his first encounter (during a trip to Connecticut) with the less segregated conditions in the North. Through his student essays and exams, we discover King's doubts about the religion of his father and we can trace his theological development. We learn of his longing for the emotional conversion experience that he witnessed others undergoing, and we follow his search to know God through study at theological seminaries. Throughout the first volume, we are treated to tantalizing hints of his mature rhetorical abilities, as in his 1945 letter to the <i>Atlanta Constitution </i>that spoke out against white racism.<br><br>Each volume in this series contains an introductory essay that traces the biographical details of Dr. King's life during the period covered.

How did the Communists win and hold power in the CIO unions, and what did they do with it once they had it? Did they subordinate the needs of workers to those of the Soviet regime? Stepan-Norris and Zeitlin find that Communists were more egalitarian and most progressive on class, race and gender issues. They were also leading fighters in exemplary workplace struggles to enlarge the freedom and enhance the human dignity of America&#39;s workers.</p><p>Left Out is a meticulous and comprehensive history of the Communist contribution to democracy, militancy, and racial justice in the dynamic unions that emerged out of America's Depression-era labor upsurge.

The Dispatcher</p><h2>Take the Cannoli: Stories From the New World</h2><p>A collection of autobiographical stories describes the American experience and the author&#39;s life, from her childhood among devout Christians to her present incarnation as a radio host, in a witty and insightful style.</p><p><b>Sarah Vowell</b> is a contributing editor for This American Life on Public Radio International and a columnist for Salon. These stories were written in Chicago and San Francisco.Broadcaster and columnist Vowell (Radio On: A Listener's Diary, 1998) presents a wonderfully eclectic mix of smart-witted, often hilarious personal essays. For every reference Vowell makes to The Great Gatsby, Huck Finn, or the Book of Revelations (three of her favorites), she quotes a combination of Sinatra, Elvis, Springsteen, and Johnny Cash a dozen times, resulting in refreshing writing with attitude. Throughout, Vowell's passion for music, sound, and rhythm are manifested in her words and her topics, whether firing a cannon with dad or making a mix tape for a friend's girlfriend. Many of the stylish essays are ``on assignment'' accounts, in which Vowell allows herself to be dressed up for a night of goth clubbing, attends Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp, checks into the grimy and ghostly Chelsea Hotel, and tries to learn to drive at 28. Her title track, ``Take the Cannoli,'' is not about music, but takes its namesake from a sound byte in The Godfathera film Vowell obsessed over when in college. The film's ``made-up, sexist East Coast thugs'' taught Vowell a valuable lesson about family, guns, and dessert. But not everything is sugar-coated in Vowell's world: she claims that ``even as a six-year-old I knew I'd never be good enough to get into heaven,'' and she recounts whining her way through Disney World in ``Species-on-Species Abuse.'' She gets cranky and sardonic, but at these moments her talent may shine brightest. In ``Dark Circles,'' Vowell, coffee in hand, comes to grips with her insomnia: lying awake in bed, she recalls her day, arriving at the less-than-soporific conclusion that ``everyday, no matter how cheerful, how innocuous, always contains within it some little speed bump of anger or hate, some wrong place, wrong time, hell-is-other-people moment of despair. Nighty night.'' Vowell's crafty writing, often free-spirited and sometimes neurotic, is like literary stand-up comedy with a lot of heart and perfect delivery.-- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now, in <em>Gods and Mortals: Modern Poems on Classical Myths</em>, we have the first anthology to gather the great 20th century myth-inspired poems from around the world.<br> "Perhaps it is because the myths echo the structure of our unconscious that every new generation of poets finds them a source of inspiration and self-recognition," says Nina Kossman in her introduction to this marvelous collection. Indeed, from Valery, Yeats, Lawrence, Rilke, Akhmatova, and Auden writing in the first half of the century to such contemporary poets as Lucille Clifton, Derek Walcott, Rita Dove, Wislawa Szymborska, and Mark Strand, the material of Greek myth has elicited a poetry of remarkably high achievement. And by organizing the poems first into broad categories such as "Heroes," "Lovers," "Trespassers," and secondly around particular mythological figures such as Persephone, Orpheus, or Narcissus, readers are treated to a fascinating spectrum of poems on the same subject. For example, the section on Odysseus includes poems by Cavafy, W. S. Merwin, Gregory Corso, Gabriel Zaid, Louise Gluck, Wallace Stevens, and many others. Thus we are allowed to see the familiar Greek hero refracted through the eyes, and sharply varying stylistic approaches, of a wide range of poets from around the world. <br> Here, then, is a collection of extraordinary poems that testifies to--and amply rewards--our ongoing fascination with classical myth.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nina Kossman</strong> is a translator, poet, writer, and playwright. The recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship and a UNESCO/PEN Short Story Award, she has translated two books by Marina Tsvetaeva, <em>In the Inmost Hour of the Soul</em> and <em>Poem of the End</em>. She lives in New York.<br>The gods and goddesses of ancient Greece truly are immortal. Dwelling in our collective unconscious, they are emblematic in their weaknesses and strengths, folly and cunning, lust and love both tragic and transcendent of all that is human and divine. Archetypes and familiars, they surface repeatedly in poetry, and Kossman, a translator and poet, has selected more than 300 outstanding twentieth-century poems from around the world, each of which offers provocative portraits of these metaphor-emblazoned figures and bold interpretations of their stories. The range of voices and styles is exciting, and her gathering of poems beneath such headings as "Lovers," "Heroes," and "Transformations," and within chapters devoted to figures such as Prometheus and Demeter, make for striking juxtapositions. Zeus, for instance, inspired Rainer Maria Rilke, Robert Graves, D. H. Lawrence, William Butler Yeats, Lucille Clifton, Frank O'Hara, Osip Mandelstam, Derek Walcott, and the Greek poet Yannis Ritsos. In other chapters, poets such as Wislawa Szymborska, Mark Strand, and Denise Levertov masterfully explore the drama and irony inherent in Greek myths, indelible tales that continue to shape our perceptions. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The range of topics discussed is refreshingly different from the average metaphysics introduction thereby making it ideal for upper division undergraduates and beginning graduate students. <p>The author sets the scene by taking the student through general theoretical matters, including discussions on the nature of metaphysics and the nature of concepts, and offering a general conception of the nature of philosophy. He then proceeds to address a diversity of metaphysical issues, ranging from colour to modality to the nature of physical objects through to the question of truth in fiction. Exercises designed to stimulate further thinking and to indicate further dimensions of the topics are posed throughout the book to encourage a more advanced study of the discipline.</p><b>Michael Jubien</b> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of California at Davis. He has published widely in the field of metaphysics, and is the author of <i>Ontology, Modality and the Fallacy of Reference</i> (1993).</p><h2>Leading in a Culture of Change</h2><p>"At the very time the need for effective leadership is reaching critical proportions, Michael Fullan's Leading in a Culture of Change provides powerful insights for moving forward. We look forward to sharing it with our grantees."<br> --Tom Vander Ark, executive director, Education, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation<br> "Fullan articulates clearly the core values and practices of leadership required at all levels of the organization. Using specific examples, he convinces us that the key change principles are equally critical for leadership in business and education organizations."<br> --John Evans, chairman, Torstar Corporation<br> "In Leading in a Culture of Change, Michael Fullan deftly combines his expertise in school reform with the latest insights in organizational change and leadership. The result is a compelling and insightful exposition on how leaders in any setting can bring about lasting, positive, systemic change in their organizations."<br> --John Alexander, president, Center for Creative Leadership<br> "Michael Fullan's work is remarkable. He masterfully captures how leaders can significantly improve their learning and performance, even in the uncontrollable, chaotic circumstances in which they practice. A tour de force."<br> --Anthony Alvarado, chancellor of instruction, San Diego City Schools<br> "Too often schools and businesses are seen as separate and foreign places. Michael Fullan blends the best of knowledge from each into an exemplary template for improving leadership in both."<br> --Terrence E. Deal, coauthor of Leading with Soul<br> Business, nonprofit, and public sector leaders are facing new and daunting challenges--rapid-paced developments in technology, sudden shifts in the marketplace, and crisis and contention in the public arena. If they are to survive in this chaotic environment, leaders must develop the skills they need to lead effectively no matter how fast the world around them is changing.<br> Leading in a Culture of Change offers new and seasoned leaders' insights into the dynamics of change and presents a unique and imaginative approach for navigating the intricacies of the change process. Michael Fullan--an internationally acclaimed expert in organizational change--shows how leaders in all types of organizations can accomplish their goals and become exceptional leaders. He draws on the most current ideas and theories on the topic of effective leadership, incorporates case examples of large scale transformation, and reveals a remarkable convergence of powerful themes or, as he calls them, the five core competencies.<br> By integrating the five core competencies--attending to a broader moral purpose, keeping on top of the change process, cultivating relationships, sharing knowledge, and setting a vision and context for creating coherence in organizations--leaders will be empowered to deal with complex change. They will be transformed into exceptional leaders who consistently mobilize their compatriots to do important and difficult work under conditions of constant change.</p><p><p><b><i>LEADING IN A CULTURE OF CHANGE</i></b> </p><p>"Valuable insight for leaders who must be able to operate under complex, uncertain circumstances."<br> <b><i>&#x2015;Quality Management Journal</i></b> </p><p><i>"Leading in a Culture of Change</i>provides some sensible, practical, and sometimes provocative insights into leadership in a rapidly changing culture . . .

Amish Grace is also a challenge to the rest of us to more fully embody the teachings of Jesus."<br> &#x2014;William H. Willimon, Bishop, the North Alabama Conference of the United Methodist Church</p> <p>The remarkable response of the Amish community to the horrific shooting of ten schoolgirls at Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, in October 2006 stunned the larger world. Amish Grace tells the incredible story of this community's reaction to this senseless shooting and explores its profoundly countercultural practice of forgiveness.</p> <p>Outsiders often hold a stereotypical view of the Amish as a stubbornly backwards people&#x2014;a view rooted in the picturesque images of buggies, beards, and bonnets. But there is much more to know about the Amish as a people, as we discovered after the Nickel Mines incident. The community's collective and radical act of forgiveness&#x2014;the loving and compassionate response to the shooter and his family&#x2014;gives us insights into who the Amish are and how they live their faith.</p> <p>Amish Grace explores the many questions the story raises about the religious beliefs that led the Amish to forgive so quickly. In a world where religion spawns so much violence and vengeance, the surprising act of Amish forgiveness begs for deeper consideration.</p><b>Donald B.

Fancifully, Beals imagines Henchman to be the reembodiment of one of the most mysterious Arthurian legends, the Fisher King&#x2014;the maimed and impotent ruler of a barren country of whom Perceval failed to ask the right questions. A myth with many permutations&#x2014;and a blurred borderland between them&#x2014;the Fisher King legend dovetails the various explanations Powell offers from his competing narrators as to why a talented young dancer would forsake her art to care for a feeble older man.<br><br>Ostensibly a novel about gossip on a cruise ship, <i>The Fisher King</i> is much more: a highly stylized narrative infused with Greek mythology, legend, and satire.</p><p><b>Anthony Powell</b> (1905-2000) has received several literary prizes in Britain and the United States, among them the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the W. H. Smith Annual Literary Award, and the T. S. Eliot Award for Creative Writing. His twelve-volume masterpiece, <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i> is available from the University of Chicago Press.Saul Henchman is impotent, crippled, grotesquely ugly. That he is nevertheless enormously attractive to women and a famous photographer to boot explains the interest he holds for his gossipy fellow passengers on a pleasure cruise to the north of Britain. Behind Powell's familiar world of upper-middle-class bitchery there looms, all the while, the legend of "the Fisher King," whose sexual mutilation has blasted his lands. After his widely acclaimed novel sequence, "A Dance to the Music of Time," any subsequent work by Powell is likely to appear slight. The Fisher King is deft enough, if dry by American standards; perhaps only Anglophiles will fully savor its quiet mixture of acerbity and comedy. For larger collections.

It is a sophisticated, no-holds-barred examination of the man, aimed at fostering a true and final understanding of who he was, why he was, and what shaped him. <br><br>Jermaine knows the real Michael as only a brother can. In this raw, honest, and poignant account, he reveals Michael the private person, not Michael &#x201c;the King of Pop.&#x201d; <br><br>Jermaine doesn&#x2019;t flinch from tackling the tough issues: the torrid press, the scandals, the allegations, the court cases, the internal politics, the ill-fated This Is It tour, and disturbing developments in the days leading up to Michael&#x2019;s death. But where previous works have presented only thin versions of a media construct, he provides a rare glimpse into the complex heart, mind, and soul of a brilliant but sometimes troubled entertainer. As a witness to history on the inside, Jermaine is the only person qualified to deliver the real Michael and reveal what made him tick, his private opinions, and unseen emotions through the most headline-making episodes of his life. <br><br>Filled with keen insight, rich in anecdotes and behind-the-scenes detail, <i>You Are Not Alone </i>is the book for any true Michael Jackson fan and for anyone trying to make sense of the artist whose death was so premature.</p><p>Jermaine Jackson, fourth-born in the musical family dynasty, was an original member of the Jackson 5.

With nearly a century separating historian Richard Bartlett from the end of the movement, Bartlett&#39;s broad perspective stresses the continuity and inevitability of this greatest element of America&#39;s Golden Age. The book focuses on the settlement of the country, the racial and ethnic composition of the people, agriculture, transportation, developments of the land, the growth of towns and cities, and the nature of frontier society as it brilliantly brings to life the frontier experience as lived by millions of Americans. Bartlett concludes that the pioneer&#39;s freedom from restrictions in a new country resulted in the unprecedented burst of energy that settled America in some 114 years.</p><p>The New Country is about humanity released from restrictions as never before, yet with the knowledge and technological skills of the nineteenth century.Richard A.

It's fascinating-very anecdotal and very emotional. It won't be like anything else you've ever read about her.<br>-John Small, editor of SaveMartha.com<br><br>From Being Martha<br><br>""Martha has taught people to do many things and not in the way an ordinary teacher would, but in her own particular way. She taught people about the good things in life-the simple things.""<br>-Martha Kostyra, Martha's mother<br><br>""My mother and I have always been close. We are not closer since the trial and prison-we've always been close. . . . Don't we all want a better life? No matter what they say about my mom, all she ever does is teach the world good things that will help them in life. So what if she shows you the perfect way to do it? Would you want your professor at school to do anything less in any other subject? Her fans know what she's all about.""<br>-Alexis Stewart, Martha's daughter<br><br>""It was all about going and finding a piece of land and living off of it, learning how to get back to nature. Listening to banjos, listening to folk music, discovering Leadbelly and the Mamas and the Papas. We used to have the greatest evenings with a bunch of hospitable people. Martha would make pies and other things for the occasions.""<br>-George Christiansen, Martha's brother, about the early years<br><br>""Martha raised the bar for me and made me think big. . . . We have an alley cat, Ricky, that lives next door at the deli, and he roams in and out of the neighborhood. Ricky has no tail, he's dirty, and he acts like a dog. One morning during the trial, Martha was in the salon wearing a three-thousand-dollar Jil Sander suit. She was sitting on one of the chairs in the back. Ricky came in and jumped on top of her and was all over her, licking her neck and putting paw marks all over her. Martha said, 'Oh my God, this cat is so dirty, this is such a dirty little cat!' But she let him crawl all over her. She just dusted the hair and dirt off. She really has a lot of kindness in her.""<br>-Eva Scrivo, Martha's friend and hairdresser</p><p><p>When Martha's longtime friend and former neighbor Lloyd Allen heard those negative stories, he hardly recognized the generous, fun-loving, and down-to-earth woman he's known and loved for years, and after she was indicted, he told Martha he was going to write this book. With Being Martha, Allen introduces you to the flesh-and-blood woman behind the glamorous public image. Drawing on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with Martha; her family, including her mother, her daughter, Alexis, her sister Laura, and her brother George; and many of her closest friends and colleagues over the years, the author at last shows us the real Martha: an enormously talented, passionate, determined, and hard-working woman who has achieved phenomenal success by inspiring and enriching the lives of millions.</p><p>Lloyd Allen weaves together fascinating, never-before-told stories and details from Martha's early years as a model, stockbroker, and caterer, telling the true story of how an always-busy Connecticut homemaker broke through big-time to become the world's most successful businesswoman at the helm of the company that bears her name, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. You'll meet Martha the mentoring teacher and benefactor through the eyes of the many people who view their time with her as the turning point in their careers, even their lives. You'll see Martha's carefree and wild side as she enjoys the simplest things with the excitement and wonder of a kid encountering them for the first time. Allen also describes what Martha really went through during her trial and prison term and how these experiences changed her&#x2014;making her stronger, more grounded, and more determined than ever to help people learn to enjoy the good things in life. </p><p>As Martha Stewart begins the next phase of her life, with multiple television shows and new venture after new venture in the works, Being Martha is a must-read for her legion of fans&#x2014;and for anyone who wants to understand the real Martha Kostyra Stewart.</p><b>Lloyd Allen</b> is a longstanding friend and former neighbor of Martha Stewart.

It is also one of the most difficult, literally and figuratively, to grasp. <br> <br> <em>Antimatter</em> explores this strange mirror world, where particles have identical yet opposite properties to those that make up the familiar matter we encounter everyday, where left becomes right, positive becomes negative, and where--should matter and antimatter meet--the resulting flash of blinding energy would make even thermonuclear explosions look feeble by comparison. Antimatter is an idea long beloved of science-fiction writers--but here, renowned science writer Frank Close shows that the reality of antimatter is even more intriguing than the fiction. We know that at one time antimatter and matter existed in perfect counterbalance, and that antimatter then perpetrated a vanishing act on a cosmic scale that remains one of the great mysteries of the universe. Today, antimatter does not exist normally, at least on Earth, but we know that it is real, as scientists are now able to make small pieces of it in particle accelerators, such as that at CERN in Geneva. Looking at the remarkable prediction of antimatter and how it grew from the meeting point of relativity and quantum theory in the early 20th century, at the discovery of the first antiparticles, at cosmic rays, annihilation, antimatter bombs, and antiworlds, Close separates the facts from the fiction about antimatter, and explains how its existence can give us profound clues about the origins and structure of the universe.<br> <br> For all those wishing to take a closer look at the flip side of the visible world, this lucidly written book shines a bright light into a truly strange realm. <br> <br></p><p><br><strong>Frank Close</strong>, OBE, is Professor of Physics at Oxford University and a Fellow of Exeter College.

Dr. McCall puts in perspective everything from disciplining and handling a stallion to the economics and legalities of breeding. Included are sections on the legal and technical aspects of breeding.</p><p>Dr. Jim McCall began his career with stallions almost 40 years ago while obtaining a Ph D. In Equine Reproduction at Texas A and M. Since that time he has stood over 300 stallions - with representative of almost every recognized breed in the world. This experience coupled with his 30 years of teaching as a college professor has been captured in this book. <p>As any of his 5000 former students will tell you, Dr. McCall believes in teaching through the art of story telling - and his books are an extension of that philosophy. They are entertaining as well as informative. </p><p>Dr. McCall is the author of two other books, Horses Behavin Badly and Influencing Horse Behavior, and is the author of the syndicated column, The Pool of Knowledge. </p><p>Retired from teaching Dr. McCall lives in Arkansas with his wife, Lynda where they write and breed and train cutting horses.</p>When I received this book, I opened it initially intending just to glance through the book. About eight chapters later, I was still at my desk reading. <p> Whether you are involved in the breeding business or not, <i>The Stallion</i> is definitely worth adding to your equine library. In keeping with McCall's style, the book is highly entertaining. Yet although it is enjoyable to read, it is no less complex or detailed in content and provides endless insights into the behavior and psychology of the breeding stallion.</p><p> McCall's thirty years of experience in the horse business, combined with his enjoyable writing style and detailed exploration of the subject matter make this book an excellent reference and all-around good read! --Show Trail Magazine<br><br><b>The Stallion</b> is an authoritative, sensitive and witty guide to standing, managing and handling stallions. The material in this book cover every aspect of what it takes to run a successful stallion breeding operation. </p><p>If you are thinking about buying a stallion, read this book first. If you own a stallion, carry a copy of this book around you. If you are a student of horse behavior, grab a copy and explore the author's lifetime of experience with stallions.</p><p>As any of the author's 5000 former college students will you, Dr. McCall believes in teaching through the art of story telling. This entertaining and informative book is vintage Jim McCall --Jimani Publishing<br><br>If your goal is to manage stallions, this book will help you benefit from the experience and insight of one of the most competent stallion manager and physiologists I know. I was a student of Jim's many years ago and credit him with showing me more horsemanship and horse management principles than any other single individual that I have known.</p><p> Jim McCall blends experience with reflection in a way that many other writers do not. He captures the kindness and courtesy of others through stories told in a detailed and mannerly way and which are not only enjoyable but also educational.</p><p> Dr. McCall is the product of a lifetime spent working and learning from horses. In addition he is a natural teacher. He has the innate ability to stimulate thought from facts that have been presented in such a way that students are able to formulate their own conclusion. </p><p> Jim McCall's observations and experiences became a part of everyone he touched. The publication of this book is a testament to him and his ability to make horses work for him. Oftentimes I have met with situations and found myself asking "What would Jim McCall had done?" Jim's lessons give strength, encouragment and conviction. --Steve Johnson, Margaux Stud, Midway, Kentucky</p></p><h2>Popular Justice: A History of American Criminal Justice</h2><p>This popular one-volume analysis of the evolution of American criminal justice places contemporary issues of crime and justice in historical perspective. Walker identifies the major periods in the development of the American system of criminal justice, from the small institutions of the colonial period to the creation of the police, the prison, and the juvenile court in the nineteenth century and the search for professionalism in the twentieth century. He argues that the democratic tradition is responsible for the worst as well as the best in the history of criminal justice in the United States. Offering a challenging perspective on current controversies in the administration of criminal justice in light of historical origins, the author explores the evolving conflict between the advocates of crime control and the advocates of due process. <p>Now in its second edition, Popular Justice has been completely revised to include the most recent scholarship on crime and justice. Walker has updated his analysis of the history of American criminal justice and explores the tension between popular passions and the rule of law. He examines changing patterns in criminal activity, the institutional development of the system of criminal justice, and the major issues concerning the administration of justice. Timely and comprehensive, this text will be useful for courses in criminal justice, legal history, and criminology.</p></p><p>Samuel Walker, Professor of Criminal Justice, University of Nebraska, Omaha.<br><em>Praise for the previous edition</em><p></p><br>"An admirable, well-conceived work.

Johnson, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Christ and the Spirit: Spirit-Christology in Trinitarian Perspective</h2><p>This is a study of Spirit-Christology--a contemporary theological model of the relationship between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Del Colle measures this christological model against trinitarian theology and tests its viability. He investigates in particular the development of a Roman Catholic Spirit-Christology, which has arisen from within the modern neo-scholastic theological tradition. Contrary to other interpreters, Del Colle argues that an incarnational christology and a Spirit-Christology are not conflicting but complementary and that this is recognized by the older and deeper tradition. In conclusion, he seeks to demonstrate the productivity of the Spirit-Christological model in reference to three major areas of concern for contemporary systematic theology: cultural pluralism and diversity, emancipation and social praxis, and inter-religious dialogue.<br></p><p>Ralph Del Colle is at Barry University, Miami Shores.<br>"Del Colle's thesis--that a full-blooded Trinitarianism and a firm insistence on the complete humanity of Christ are entirely compatible--is of immense significance to Christian theology today. The author's technical competence in presenting the historical material, his subtle constructive reflections, and his concluding demonstration of the fruitfulness of his solution for other problems are all signs of a first-rate mind. With this book Del Colle could emerge as one of the most powerful figures in the rising generation of Christian theologians in the U.S."--Geoffrey Wainwright, <em>Robert E. Cushman Professor of Christian Theology, Duke University</em><p></p><br>"[<em>Christ and the Spirit</em>] unfolds within the world of scholastic theology. Del Colle is a brilliant expositor of that world; he has mastered the distinctions and the arguments; he works within its logic. As a historical theologian Del Colle is objective, fair, and completely irenic in laying out the positions he considers."--<em>Theological Studies</em><p></p><br>"Ralph Del Colle's study is an important book."--<em>Theology</em><p></p><br>"This is a remarkably fine and interesting study....It is one of those books whose promise and direction are evident from the beginning."--<em>Modern Theology</em><p></p><br>"Del Colle's work is an important contribution."--<em>Journal of Ecumenical Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Circumplex Models of Personality and Emotions</h2><p>During the past few decades, two major approaches have been used in efforts to define the structure of personality traits and emotions. One is the five factor analytic model. The other is a circumplex. The circumplex approach focuses on determining the similarity structure of all traits and emotions, and its underlying assumption is that a relatively seamless circular ordering (or circumplex) is an economical description of the relations among traits and among emotions. This volume is designed to apply the circumplex concept to personality and emotions. It brings together the work of major contributors in the field to show how the circumplex idea can be applied to the domains of personality, emotions, personality disorders and test construction. The circumplex models also has wide implications for occupational interests and choice, for psychotherapty and for family therapy.</p><p></p><h2>Left Out: Pragmatism, Exceptionalism, and the Poverty of American Marxism, 1890-1922 (New Studies in American Intellectual and Cultural History)</h2><p><p>"Why is there no socialism in the United States?" We can best deal with this age-old question, writes Brian Lloyd, by rephrasing it. In this provocative rethinking of American radicalism, Lloyd asks instead: What happened to Marx's methods and concepts when American radicals tried to put them into practice?</p><p>As an answer, Lloyd offers a detailed analysis of the Marxian doctrine that Debs-era socialists tried to understand and put to use in changing American society. He highlights the amicable relationship that developed between Marxism and pragmatism, showing how this courtship ultimately impoverished the radicals who cultivated it. Trying to gain a foothold in the struggle to shape American society and social science in the early twentieth century, Marxists invigorated American liberalism while placing themselves on the fringe of liberal discourse and rendering themselves irrelevant. </p><p>Whether in the name of Darwin or Dewey, those who claimed to be squaring Marxism with "American reality" succeeded only in creating American versions of the petty bourgeois socialism that Marx had castigated in 1848. The poverty of American Marxism, Lloyd concludes, was above all an ideological condition--the result of radicals' having imbibed far too little, rather than too much, of the Marxism of Marx.</p></p><p><p>What happened to Marx's methods and concepts when American radicals tried to put them into practice?</p><p>Brian Lloyd is assistant professor of history at the University of California, Riverside.</p></p><h2>The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</em> opens an epic adventure which continues with <em>Louise de La Valli�re</em> and reaches its climax in <em>The Man in the Iron Mask</em>.

The book combines well-known images, along with lesser-known illustrations.</p><p>Author-illustrator Tasha Tudor is one of America's most recognized and beloved artists. Her many classic children's books--<i>Pumpkin Moonshine</i>, <i>1 Is One</i>, and <i>Corgiville Fair</i> to name a few--have virtually raised generations of children, and all signs point to their continued popularity for generations to come. In <i>The Art of Tasha Tudor</i>, the artist's longtime business partner and friend, Harry Davis, presents a remarkable retrospective of her life and work, featuring 150 of her finest drawings and paintings, from books, fashion designs, holiday cards, and her personal sketchbooks. The beautiful tribute is not without controversy, however, if only in that Davis and Tudor apparently parted company on not the best of terms. However, for the innumerable devotees of Tasha Tudor's extraordinary lifestyle and art, the book is indeed a comprehensive treasure. Tracing Tudor's life from early years with her family through some difficult periods with her husband and children to the present, Davis includes many amusing, poignant, and cutting anecdotes that could only come from an intimate acquaintance. Throughout, of course, are Tudor's exquisite illustrations of small critters and adorable children, most often set against a rustic New England backdrop. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Harry Davis has studied the art of Tasha Tudor for thirty years. A graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University, he taught school before becoming Tasha Tudor&#39;s Business partner and initiating her landmark exhibition at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum in Williamsburg in 1997. He is the author of Tasha Tudor&#39;s Dollhouse and Forever Christmas.</p><h2>Biology Today &amp; Tomorrow with Physiology</h2><p>BIOLOGY TODAY AND TOMORROW is packed with applications that are relevant to your daily life.

The book examines Indian politics, religious beliefs, caste, environment, nationalism, colonialism, and gender, among other issues. The book also discusses long-term economic development, the impact of global trade, and the origins of rural poverty. Peter Robb's clear, fluent narrative explores the interplay between India's empires, regions of rule, customs, and beliefs, and is an ideal starting-point for those with an interest in India's past and present.<br></p><p><b>Peter Robb</b> is professor of Indian history at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, one of the world's major centers for South Asian studies.<br>"...his book is accessible in new ways for even the lay Indian reader."--<i>The Hindu</i> (India)<br> -- <i>Review</i></p><h2>Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries (Clarendon Paperbacks)</h2><p>The history of witchcraft and sorcery has attracted a great deal of interest and debate, but until now studies have been largely from the Anglo-Saxon perspective. This book shows how that approach has blurred our understanding and definition of the issues involved, and sheds new light on the history of witchcraft in England. What had thus far been seen as peculiar to England is here shown to be characteristic of much of northern Europe. Taking into account major new developments in the historiography of witchcraft--in methodology, and in the chronological and geographical scope of the studies--the authors explore the relationship between witchcraft, law, and theology; the origins and nature of the witch's sabbath; the sociology and criminology of witch-hunting; and the comparative approach to European witchcraft. An impressive amount of archival work by all of the contributors has produced an indispensable guide to the study of witchcraft, of interest not only to historians, but to anthropologists, criminologists, psychologists, and sociologists.<br></p><p>Bengt Ankarloo is at Lund University.

Perfect for travelers (not least those of the armchair variety), this concise, readable, and even witty book offers both an authoritative look at the history, art, architecture, and archaeological aspects of the region, and expert advice on how to find the sites and monuments of the greatest interest to the visitor. <em>The Holy Land</em> takes the reader from Stone Age caves and the grandiose buildings of Herod the Great, to Roman Roads, Byzantine churches, Crusader fortifications, and beautifully decorated Mameluke houses. Murphy-O'Connor--who has spent twenty years guiding tourists in the Middle East--offers detailed instructions on various routes that will encourage the traveler to venture off the beaten path, and provides the latest information on the most recent excavations, complete with detailed site plans and maps. For the visitor to a region rich in history and religious tradition the guide is indispensable; for the casual reader, it offers hours enjoyment right at home.</p><p>This book is an excellent choice for visitors to the Holy Land who want to take an in-depth look at the area's historical sites. Among this Oxford guide's special features are 150 site plans, maps, diagrams, and photographs; routes through the Old City of Jerusalem; a brief historical outline; and a glossary of essential terms. <i>Oxford Archeological Guides: The Holy Land</i> is also a useful source of practical advice on museum hours, suggested dress, travel and lodging contacts, as well as information on visiting desert locations such as the Judaean Desert and the hills of Elat. <p> The first half of the book covers sites in the city of Jerusalem, grouping them into areas for easy exploration. Maps accompany each site described. The second half of the book features an alphabetical listing--from <i>Abu Ghosh</i> to <i>Yehiam</i>--of key sites scattered throughout the Holy Land. Each site includes a reference to its position on the "Israel Touring Map" (available at bookstores in Israel), and especially recommended sites are starred or double-starred. </p><p> As an added bonus to this edition, more than 70 shaded sidebars offer a mini-anthology of ancient texts. "Not only do such documents illustrate the sort of material on which our historical knowledge is based, but their vividness and immediacy give a new dimension to the sites," writes author Murphy-O'Connor. <i>--Kathryn True</i></p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Jerome Murphy-O'Connor</strong> is Professor of the New Testament at the Ecole Biblique et Archaeolgique Francaise in Jerusalem.

Kathleen Kendall-Tackett and an elite group of researchers explore the ways physical and psychological stressors such as poor sleep, PTSD, and depression, trigger the inflammatory response and increase the risk of disease. They approach this material from a variety of perspectives. Chapters in Part I describe the biological processes involved in inflammation, focusing on both the typical bodily response to threat as well as on the long-term deleterious effects of stress upon the immune system; while chapters in Part II examine the role of psychosocial stress in disease etiology. Throughout, chapter authors present evidence of connections between mind and body, and emphasize the need for improved communication between physicians and mental health care providers.</p><p></p><h2>The Price of Salt, or Carol</h2><p><p>An unlikely encounter between Therese, a young sales clerk, and Carol, a lonely homemaker, leads to an amorous romance in this classic work of lesbian fiction.

Whether you are a novice or an expert indoor gardener, this indispensable guide is the most authoritative and useful handbook on house plants you can own.</p><p><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>HOUSE PLANTS</b> </p><p> <b>1 ABUTILON MEGAPOTAMICUM</b> 'Variegatum' </p><p> <b>Family</b> Malvaceae. </p><p> <b>Origin</b> Brazil. </p><p> <b>Description</b> An evergreen shrub of drooping habit with slender stems bearing ovate, pointed, toothed and sometimes lobed leaves 6-10 cm (2-4 in) long. The leaf blade has yellow blotches. The pendulous flowers are bell-shaped and grow singly or in pairs from the leaf axils. Each flower has a red calyx which partially enfolds the yellow corolla, from which dark anthers project; length of flower is 4-5 cm (2 in). The flowering season is from May to October. </p><p> <b>Care</b> The species can be grown outside in warm regions. Indoors it needs plenty of bright light, even direct sun for several hours daily, and can be kept at medium temperatures of 18-22�C (64-71�F). Water regularly while growing, letting the surface of the soil dry out before repeating. Reduce amount of water during rest period. Feed with standard liquid fertilizer fortnightly from April to October. Soil made of organic matter, peat and sand in equal proportions. Replace the plants every 2-3 years with new specimens, preferably obtained from cuttings. Prune vigorously in March-April, reducing length of branches by one third. </p><p> <b>Propagation</b> The species itself can be propagated from seed or from cuttings; the cultivar 'Variegatum' only from cuttings. Take 10 cm (4 in) tip cuttings from April to June, planting them in mixture of equal parts peat and sand. Wrap in plastic bag and put in cold greenhouse. </p><p> <b>Pests and diseases</b> Frequently attacked by scale insects. </p><p> <b>2 ACACIA RETINODES</b> </p><p> Wirilda </p><p> <b>Family</b> Leguminosae. </p><p> <b>Origin</b> Australia. </p><p> <b>Description</b> Also known as <i>A. floribunda.</i> Shrub or small tree, tree, up to 9 m (30 ft) tall; in natural environment has light green or bluish evergreen leaves, 8-10 cm (3-4 in) long. May grow to height of 120 cm (4 ft) in pot. Small, round, scented yellow flowers, in loose clusters. Flowering continues from spring to October. The fruits are flat pods. </p><p> <b>Care</b> Grows well in all soils, even lime soil. Soil must be well drained. Can be used as stock for compound-leaved acacias which are calcifuges. Cultivated outdoors in temperate climates; grown indoors in colder areas. The plant needs plenty of light. Water abundantly in spring-summer, moderately in winter. Feed with liquid fertilizer every two weeks from May to August. The best growing medium is a mixture of 2 parts organic soil, 1 part peat, 1 part coarse sand. Repot annually, in March, using gradually larger pots up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. Pruning unnecessary, but to keep the plant small, cut back branches after flowering. </p><p> <b>Propagation</b> From seed. Sow in April at 16�C (61�F). As soon as seedlings are a few centimeters in height prick out in 8 cm (3 in) pots; repot in 5-10 cm (2-4 in) pots. Can also be propagated from cuttings, taking 5-10 cm (2-4 in) twigs from part of an old branch. Plant in mixtures of peat and sand, in equal parts, in hot-bed at temperature of 16-18�C (61-64�F). Rooting takes several months. </p><p> <b>Pests and diseases</b> A fairly resistant plant, not subject to any particular diseases. </p><p> <b>3 ACALYPHA HISPIDA</b> </p><p> Red-hot cat's tail, chenille plant </p><p> <b>Family</b> Euphorbiaceae. </p><p> <b>Origin</b> India, Java. </p><p> <b>Description</b> Shrub growing to height of 75 cm (30 in), with large, ovate, bright green leaves, hairy underneath, up to 25 cm (10 in) long. The inflorescences are long, drooping spikes, 20-50 cm (8-20 in), bright red, growing from July to October in the leaf axils. </p><p> <b>Varieties</b> <i>A. hispida</i> 'Alba' has pinky-white flowers. </p><p> <b>Care</b> The plant needs bright light, otherwise it will fail to flower and will grow too tall, but it dislikes direct sun. It does well at high temperatures, never below 16�C (61�F). It cannot stand dry air; place the pot in holder filled with damp gravel and spray the foliage daily in spring-summer until flower buds appear. Water plentifully. Reduce amount of water during winter dormancy. Cultivate in mixture of 1 part organic soil, 1 part peat and 1 part coarse sand. Give liquid fertilizer fortnightly during growth. Very decorative in first year; prune and repot or replace annually in early spring if too big. </p><p> <b>Propagation</b> In March-April prune the branches, taking 810 cm (3-4 in) tip cuttings, or detach young lateral shoots with a piece of bark and woody stem, planting them in small pots containing moist soil. Wrap in plastic bags and place in indirect sunlight at a minimum temperature of 21�C (70�F). When cuttings resume growth, roots have developed. </p><p> <b>Pests and diseases</b> Scale insects and red spider attack. </p><p> <b>4 ADIANTUM CAPILLUS-VENERIS</b> </p><p> Southern maidenhair fern, Venus's-hair </p><p> <b>Family</b> Polypodiaceae. </p><p> <b>Origin</b> Subtropical and temperate zones. </p><p> <b>Description</b> Rhizomatous fern of modest size, maximum 30 cm (12 in) tall. Delicate, pale green triangular leaves, with fan-like pinnules on black leaf stalks. Species suitable for growing under glass or indoors. </p><p> <b>Varieties</b> <i>Adiantum capillus-veneris</i> 'Mairisii.' There are no other varieties of this species. There are, however, varieties of related species <i>(A. raddianum, A. hispidulum, A. tenerum)</i> which are also commonly known as maidenhair fern. </p><p> <b>Care</b> Grows well in warm, humid sheltered spots, even in the open provided the temperature does not fall below 12�C (53�F). Needs bright but filtered light and a very humid atmosphere. Not always easy to grow indoors because of the difficulty of maintaining the right measure of humidity. The roots should always be slightly moist, and must not be allowed to dry out nor be drenched. Water frequently but in moderate amounts, letting the surface of the compost dry between successive waterings. Spray the foliage daily, especially in warm, dry surroundings. Grow in a mixture of 1 part organic soil and 1 part coarse peat. Feed monthly or more often during the growing period with liquid fertilizer. </p><p> <b>Propagation</b> In spring divide the clumps, leaving a piece of rhizome attached to each, and pot. Place in the shade and water carefully. </p><p> <b>Pests and diseases</b> Subject to animal parasites: root scale insects, leaf miners which cause black spots on the leaves, and soil lice which feed on the roots. </p><p> Copyright � 1986 by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A.Milan</p>Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Kidnapped (sch Cl) (Scholastic Classics)</h2><p>Stevenson's famous novel of seafaring adventure, with an introduction by TK<br><br>Shipwreck. Murder. Flight. Intrigue. And, of course, kidnapping. David Balfour's adventures on the high seas are among the most evocative in classic literature.</p><p>Robert Louis Stevenson always considered &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; the tale of 17-year-old David Balfour&#39;s adventures in the remote islands and highlands of Scotland with renegade soldier Alan Breck Stewart, to be his greatest novel, but when the classic adventure tale was published in 1886, it was missing much of what its author held dear. His English publisher had excised many of the Scottish words and phrases he had used to evoke the suspense of the novel. From simple misreadings to deliberate revisions, subsequent printed editions represented major departures from Stevenson&#39;s handwritten text. Now Barry Menikoff has restored the author&#39;s language and punctuation, as well as the authentic Scots quality of his diction. In doing so, he has given readers a clearer picture of both Stevenson&#39;s skill as a storyteller and the novel&#39;s social and political context.For the better part of a century &#34;Kidnapped&#34; has occupied an ambiguous position in literary and cultural studies. Its initial appearance in a weekly magazine called &#34;Young Folks Paper,&#34; along with Stevenson&#39;s disingenuous comment that the novel had a diverting rather than a serious aim, have in effect trapped the book in the never-neverland of children&#39;s literature. Yet it is universally acknowledges as a classic of world literature and the novelist always considered it his finest achievement -- taken together with its sequel, &#34;David Balfour,&#34; the best he was capable of in fiction. Now, for the first readers can plainly see why Stevenson placed his story of David Balfour on so high a pedestal. Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in California&#39;s Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff faithfully reproduces the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the punctuation (of which the novelist was a master) and recovering the distinctive and often singular language that had been altered or deleted. The effect is to deepen and illuminate the Scottish texture of the novel. For a book so embedded in Scottish history as &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; so revelatory of its fierce loyalties and violent enmities, the discovery that Stevenson was even more nationalistic than we had known comes at an opportune moment, with the opening of the new Scottish parliament. This handsome new edition of a novel whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in &#34;Young Folks.&#34; Professor Menikoff&#39;s substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context, and enables us to see why Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. And in his extensive notes to the novel he reveals Stevenson&#39;s enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for &#34;Kidnapped&#34; was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the &#34;Oxford English Dictionary&#34; and the &#34;Scottish National Dictionary.&#34; Finally, for a tale that charts the &#34;wanderings&#34; of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.</p><h2>Diamond As Big As the Ritz &amp; Other Stories (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>The Diamond as Big as the Ritz is an ominous fable about the pursuit of great wealth. Readers will be transported to a fabulous fantasy land of such opulence that its very existence has to remain a jealously guarded secret. Fatal consequences lie in store for &#39;bona fide&#39; guests and uninvited visitors alike, while the sybaritic luxury of the place is evoked in an effortless prose style which is quintessentially F. Scott Fitzgerald. Also featured in this volume are The Cut-Glass Bowl, May Day, The Rich Boy, Crazy Sunday, An Alcoholic Case, The Lees of Happiness, The Lost Decade and Babylon Revisited</p><p>Francis Scott Fitzgerald was born in 1896 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and educated at Princeton. Stationed in Alabama, he met and later married Zelda Sayre. His first novel, This Side of Paradise published in 1920, was a tremendous critical and commercial success. Fitzgerald followed with The Beautiful and the Damned in 1922, The Great Gatsby in 1925 and Tender is the Night in 1934. He was working on The Last Tycoon (1941) when he died, in Hollywood, in 1940.Much of Scott's work is going public domain, and reprints are coming fast and furious. Besides "Diamond," this contains other gems, e.g., "The Ice Palace" and "Bernice Bobs Her Hair."

The results then were inconclusive but intriguing. Now, 12 years later, little new material has been added (some more accurate dating; an additional 1979 expedition which yielded little evidence). Zink is forever plagued by being inadequately equipped to investigate the finds. But the book is not presented as science so much as adventure in the tradition of Thor Heyerdahl and the great exploration narratives. Zink's writing is lively, and the arcane avenues of knowledge that he pursues are titillating if bizarre. As the narration of a nondiscovery, this necessarily falls a little flat; if you have the first edition, there's no need to buy this one. Still, there are so few frontiers, and so few with the thirst for exploration in their souls.

Advertisers and politicians exploit it; intellectuals (self-styled) even flaunt it. I hope that this wise and witty book will provide cures where they are possible, and warnings where they are necessary.<br> <br> "It's also a lot of fun. I can guarantee that 100%."--Arthur C. Clarke<br> <br> "Dewdney retells with charm and wit magnificent morsels of mathematical mayhem discovered by his army of volunteer 'abuse detectives.' From 'sample trashing' to 'numerical terrorism,' from 'percentage pumping' to 'dimensional dementia,' 200% of Nothing plumbs the depths of innumeracy in daily life and reveals what ordinary people can do about it.<br> <br> A rich, readable, instructive, and persuasive book."--Lynn Arthur Steen, Professor of Mathematics, St. Olaf College</p><p>If you know the difference between lies, damned lies, and statistics, give a copy of A.K. Dewdney's <i>200% of Nothing</i> to your friends to get them up to speed. If you don't know the difference, consider this funny, engaging little book a crash course in numeracy, the mathematical equivalent of literacy. Opening with two chapters on the importance of this dying talent, Dewdney (formerly <i>Scientific American</i>'s "Mathematical Recreations" writer) spooks the reader with real examples of government agencies, media outlets, and--of course--car salesmen deceiving their audiences with beguiling mathematical sleights of hand. It's all too easy for us to think we're immune to such tactics until we actually see them laid out for us in prose as clear and disarming as Dewdney's. From these tactics he delves more deeply into practical examples of particular problems that often catch us unaware. Gambling, advertisements using bizarre-but-normal-looking charts, and bad science all come in for thorough examinations, and the reader is amazed and occasionally angered at the shamelessness of the purveyors of misleading statistics. The book closes with two chapters designed to make readers "mathematically streetwise," with exercises to help you grasp ratios, very large and small numbers, and probabilities more intuitively. <i>200% of Nothing</i> inspires learning and makes it interesting--if you want to see through the fog of numbers surrounding politicians and advertisements, there's no better place to start. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>A revealing look at the variety of methods used by advertisers, politicians and corporations to mislead and manipulate the public by means of fancy mathematical footwork. A prominent mathematics author and columnist shows how this mathematical abuse is accomplished, how to recognize it and avoid it. Contains hundreds of actual examples of mathematical chicanery. The last chapter provides further explanations of the mathematics underlying the manipulators covered in each chapter.</p><h2>North Carolina Quilts</h2><p>This magnificent volume features color photographs of more than 100 quilts crafted in North Carolina between the early nineteenth century and 1976. Included are chintz applique quilts, intricately pieced and appliqued quilts, crazy quilts, and examples of ingenious thrift in quilting with found and salvaged materials.<br><br>The quilts were chosen from more than 10,000 that owners brought to be recorded by the North Carolina Quilt Project during a series of statewide Quilt Documentation Days in 1985-86. Because the quilts are privately owned, many have never been seen publicly. The text presents the lives and times of the quiltmakers, accompanied by many vintage photographs from family collections. Whether these women made quilts to pass the time, warm their families, beautify their lives, or serve as symbols of love and togetherness, they used their fabric with uncommon artistry and craftsmanship.<br><br></p><p>"Crammed with colorful history, anecdotes and legends that vividly portray the lives of Carolina women and their families from early colonial days to the present.

The premise of the text is that good reading and clear thinking go hand in hand. For this reason, it emphasizes practice in sustained, analytical reading. Students first work with high-quality short passages before moving on to more substantive pieces of greater complexity. The readings explore diverse subjects: anthropology, sports, human behavior, politics, social policy, education, ethics, autobiography, personal reminiscence, the minority and immigrant experience, humor, satire, and so forth. The passages also reflect diverse writing styles, thereby giving students the experience of reading high-level prose by its best practitioners.<br><br> This book succeeds when students become more self-assured about their reading and when they recognize that reading well&#x2015;with confidence, fluency, and enjoyment&#x2015;is a significant part of their emotional and academic lives. As the book&#x2019;s epigram by Tobias Wolff says: &#x201c;A true piece of writing is a dangerous thing. It can change your life.&#x201d; Students will feel genuine excitement when they encounter a writer who shows them a new way of looking at their lives and at the world. It is this feeling&#x2015;this inspiration&#x2015;that Deanne Spears imparts.</p><p>Deanne Spears is originally from Portland, Oregon. She now considers herself a native Californian, having moved to Los Angeles when freeways and smog were relatively new concepts. During her childhood and adolescence, she spent carefree summers i na small farming community in northwest Iowa.

It will enable the reader to master the fundamentals of 3D computer graphics as well as acting as a complete resource for anyone interested in 3D modelling. It provides detailed coverage of both realistic and non-realistic images.<br> <br>This is the third edition of a book which deals with the processes involved in converting a mathematical or geometric description of an object into a visualisation that simulates the appearance of a real object. Traditionally computer graphics has created pictures by starting with a very detailed geometric description, subjecting this to a series of transformations that orient a viewer and objects in 3D space, then imitating reality by making the objects look solid and real - a process known as rendering. Nowadays this is proving insufficient for the new demands of moving computer imagery and virtual reality. Much research is being carried out into how to model complex objects, where the nature and shape of the objects changes dynamically and into capturing the richness of the world without having to model every detail explicitly. This text explores and relates thee resulting in diverse synthesis and modelling methods.<br></p><p>The third edition of Alan Watt's <i>3D Computer Graphics</i>, a bible of computer graphics, includes a CD-ROM full of examples and updated information on graphics and rendering algorithms. The book discusses many of the techniques that have evolved in the seven years since the previous edition was published.<p> <i>3D Computer Graphics</i> is a textbook, and it's designed for serious programmers creating graphics applications (not end users). Over the course of 16 sections, Watt introduces the concepts and implementation of computer imaging, from "Mathematical Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" to "Representation and Rendering" and ending with "Image-Based Rendering and Photo-Modeling." The last section, devoted to computer animation, includes methods for linked structures, collision detection, and particle animation (to name a few).</p><p> Although the topics are sometimes hard to grasp, Mr. Watt writes clearly and concisely, making generous use of diagrams to help convey the principles described in the text.</p><p> The accompanying CD-ROM includes over a dozen studies of computer graphics techniques and rendering algorithms. Presented in HTML, the exhaustive studies, each with a matrix of thumbnails, demonstrates the varied achievable results. One minor complaint here: although the thumbnails can be clicked to view a much larger image, the larger versions come in .tif format, which few (if any) Web browsers can view. Users will need another application to view them. Having the large image in .jpg format would have enabled the reader to view it in the already-open Web browser.</p><p> <i>3D Computer Graphics</i> is ideally suited to graphics programmers and researchers working to create new medical imaging devices; geological research systems; virtual structural testing systems for aircraft, cars, and spacecraft; or effects and photorealistic Hollywood animation. <i>--Mike Caputo</i></p><p>The third edition of this book continues to focus on the 3D aspects of computer graphics, and reflects the growing demand for real-time applications such as games and virtual reality. It also includes new material on Visualization in Scientific Computing and graphics standards such as PHIGS. It deals with the processes involved in converting a mathematical or geometric description of an object -- a computer graphics model -- into a visualization -- a two-dimensional projection -- that simulates the appearance of a real object. Alan Watt provides students with a knowledge of complex and emerging topics in the field of computer graphics, including advances in rendering and new material on animation.

Building on a 10-year case study of a successful school&#x2013;university partnership, the authors examine the support, mentoring, and resources needed to transform the college opportunities and life chances for underrepresented urban youth. Featuring firsthand accounts from student participants, the book documents how the model provided college access to some of the most selective and prestigious universities across the nation. Because this partnership situates college access within a social justice framework, it is one of the more unique programs in the country.</p><p><strong>Book Features:</strong></p><ul><li> Shows what successful partnerships look like when schools and districts work with common goals and outcomes. </li><li> Documents an approach that identifies promising students early in their high school careers.</li><li> Emphasizes college access with a commitment to social justice, equity, and investment in schools and communities. </li><li> Focuses on student perspectives to identify mentoring and high school resources that make a difference in their college pursuit. </li><li> Includes viewpoints of university personnel and parents about the impact of the program on students.</li></ul></p><p><p><br> "Few social problems are of more pressing importance than the challenge of increasing access to higher education.

This handbook provides all the information one would need on these tricky units of grammar.<br><br><em>All About Particles</em> covers more than 70 particles those that are used regularly as well as those used less frequently in more than 200 uses. The book can be approached as a guiding textbook and studied from beginning to end. It is as a reference book, however, that <em>All About Particles</em> shines. It is light and easy to carry, slim enough to fit into the corner of a shoulder bag, and concise enough to quickly clarify particle-related questions. It is a priceless tool for any serious student of Japanese.</p><p><br>NAOKO CHINO is a lecturer at Sophia University, Tokyo, and author of <em>Japanese Verbs at a Glance</em>, <em>A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Sentence Patterns</em>, and <em>How to Tell the Difference Between Japanese Particles</em>.<br>Below is the complete section on Wa, minus the original macrons and with Japanese script represented by X's. <p>WA Note: Wa has several usages, but its basic function is to set off a topic (e.g., of conversation) from the rest of the sentence, which talks about the topic. Technically, wa does not indicate case (subject, object, etc.). However, in practical terms, it often (but not always) comes after the subject of the sentence. See also to wa (#7) and -te wa (#47). </p><p>. </p><p>1. Indicates that information is being presented about something that is already known or that has been identified. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Asoko ni akai hon ga arimasu ne. Are WA kanji no hon desu. Over there is a red book, right. It's a kanji book. / See the red book over there? That's a kanji book. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Ano daigaku WA, Yotsuya-eki no chikaku ni arimasu. That university -- it's near Yotsuya Station. / That university is near Yotsuya Station. </p><p>. </p><p>2. Indicates a topic, which is then identified or explained. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Ashita WA nichiyobi desu. As for tomorrow, it's Sunday. / Tomorrow is Sunday. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Kujira WA sakana de wa arimasen. As for the whale, it is not a fish. / The whale is not a fish. </p><p>Note: If ga replaces wa in these sentences, the noun which it follows is no longer being presented as a topic but as the subject of the predicate (see ga, #2, I-2). The switch from topic (wa) to definite subject (ga) lays stress on the latter. For example: </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Asatte WA nichiyobi desu ne. Chigaimasu. Ashita GA nichiyobi desu yo. The day after tomorrow is Sunday, isn't it. You're wrong there. Tomorrow is Sunday. </p><p>. </p><p>3. In the construction N + wa N + ga, wa indicates a topic (the first noun) about which an aspect or quality (the second noun) is explained. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Zo WA hana GA nagai desu. The elephant -- its nose is long. / Elephants have long noses. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Takemoto-san WA seikaku GA yasashii desu. As for Takemoto, her personality is gentle. / Takemoto has a gentle nature. </p><p>. </p><p>4. Used to show contrast between two items or ideas, both of which are signified by wa. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Kanji WA muzukashii desu ga, Nihon-go no bunpo WA amari muzukashiku nai-n desu. Kanji are difficult, but Japanese grammar is not very difficult. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hokkaido no fuyu WA samui desu ga, Tokyo WA atatakai desu. The Hokkaido winter is cold, but [the] Tokyo [winter] is warm. / It's cold in Hokkaido in the winter, but warm in Tokyo. </p><p>Note: In some cases, only one item or idea is explicitly mentioned. For example, in the following sentence, the implication is that the person might go to a cheaper restaurant. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx </p><p>Takai kara, ano resutoran ni WA ikimasen. Because it's expensive, I won't go to that restaurant. / I am not going to that restaurant because it's too expensive. </p><p>Note: In its contrastive function, wa comes after other particles (e.g., ni wa, de wa). Two important exceptions are when it replaces ga and o, as in the next example. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Bata o kaimashita ka. Magarin WA kaimashita ga, bata WA kaimasen deshita. Did you buy some butter? I bought some margarine, but I didn't buy any butter. / I bought some margarine, but not any butter. </p><p>. </p><p>5. In the forms V-te wa iru (first example below) and V-masu base followed by wa and suru (second and third examples), wa indicates emphasis. See also -te wa (#47). </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Konpyuta o motte WA imasu ga, mada tsukatte (WA) imasen. I own a computer [I do own a computer], but I haven't used it yet. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Ano hito o shitte WA imasu ga, amari hanashita koto WA arimasen. I know him, but I haven't spoken to him much. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Ocha WA nomimashita ga, jikan ga nakatta no de shokuji WA shimasen deshita. I had some tea, but since there wasn't much time, I didn't eat (have a meal).</p></p><h2>The American Short Story and Its Writer: An Anthology</h2><p><br>This groundbreaking anthology is the first to offer a truly inclusive survey of the American short story along with a unique array of major critical statements and commentaries by the writers themselves.<br></p><p><br><br><b>ANN CHARTERS</b> (Ph.D., Columbia University), professor of English at the University of Connecticut, has taught courses in the short story for many years.

This second volume of Victorian Christmas ghost stories contains fifteen tales, most of which have never been reprinted. They represent a mix of the diverse styles and themes common to Victorian ghost fiction and include works by once-popular authors like Grant Allen and Eliza Lynn Linton as well as contributions from anonymous or wholly forgotten writers. This volume also features a new introduction by Prof. Allen Grove. </p> <p> &#x201c;At first I was aware only of a bluish, misty, phosphorescent light, and then a ghastly terror, that froze the very blood in my veins, seized me, for suddenly I saw rise up out of the inky darkness the form of a man&#x2014;the eyes of a hideous red, fixed on mine with a look of hate ...&#x201d; - Coulson Kernahan, &#x201c;Haunted!&#x201d; </p> <p> &#x201c;As I stood in breathless horror, unable to stir a limb, the figure raised its arm, a skeleton hand emerged from the heavy folds of the cloak, and touched my elbow.

In 1974, women imprisoned at New York's maximum-security prison at Bedford Hills staged what is known as the August Rebellion. Protesting the brutal beating of a fellow prisoner, the women fought off guards, holding seven of them hostage, and took over sections of the prison. While many have heard of the 1971 Attica prison uprising, the August Rebellion remains relatively unknown even in activist circles. <i>Resistance Behind Bars </i>challenges and seeks to change such oversights. Emphasizing women's agency in resisting the conditions of their confinement through forming peer education groups, clandestinely arranging ways for children to visit mothers in distant prisons, and raising public awareness about their lives, the book will spark further discussion and research into the lives of incarcerated women and galvanize much-needed outside support for their struggles. This updated and revised edition includes a new chapter about transgender, transsexual, intersex, and gender-variant people in prison and the specific challenges that they face.</p></p><p><p><b>Victoria Law</b> is a writer, photographer, and prisoner rights supporter. She helped initiate NYC Books Through Bars, a group that sends free books to prisoners nationwide, and she writes articles and gives public presentations about the needs of women in prison.

But as Vikki Law shows in this multifaceted book, all that is unseen is not absent. Guided by years of anti-prison organizing and a palpable feminist practice, Law documents the many ways women challenge the twin forces of prison and patriarchy, each trying to render women invisible. In the face of attempts at erasure, women prisoners resist to survive and survive to resist.

From the Crystal Palace through to the towering glass spires of today's cities, few architectural materials have held such immense symbolic resonance in the modern era. </p><p><i>The Age of Glass</i> explores the cultural and technological ascension of glass in modern and contemporary architecture. Showing how the use of glass is driven as much by changing cultural concerns as it is by developments in technology and style, it traces the richly interwoven material, symbolic, and ideological histories of glass to show how it has produced and dispersed meaning in architecture over the past two centuries. </p><p>The book's chapters focus on key moments within the modern history of architecture, moments when glass came to the forefront of architectural thought, and which illustrate how glass has been used at different times to project different cultural ideas. A wide range of topics are explored &#x2013; from the tension between expressionism and functionalism, to the persistent theme of glass and social class, to how glass has reflected political ideas from Nazism through to today's global consumer capitalism. The book also grapples with current arguments about sustainability, while, taking into account the advent of digital LED screens and 'smart glass', offering new cultural perspectives on the future and asking what glass architecture will signify in the digital age. Combining close readings of buildings with insights drawn from research, plus good storytelling and strong contemporary relevance, <i>The Age of Glass</i> offers a fascinating new perspective on modern architecture and culture.</p></p><p><b>Stephen Eskilson</b> is Professor of Art History at Eastern Illinois University.

The author fuses the contemporary theories of clinical treatment with the creative processes of art therapy to arrive at a synthesis which yields successful outcomes when working with adolescents. Clinicians of allied disciplines, particularly art therapists, will find practical suggestions for using imagery to enrich their relationships with teenaged clients. The process of using art-making therapeutically, and the challenges of applying creativity in the current mental health world, are explored.</p><p>Shirley Riley reviews current theories on adolescent development and therapy, and emphasizes the primary importance of relying on the youths' own narrative in the context of their social and economic backgrounds. She has found this approach preferential to following pre-designed assessment directives as a primary function of art therapy. Family, group and individual treatment are examined, as is the adolescent's response to short- and long-term treatment in residential and therapeutic school settings. The book is firmly rooted in Riley's clinical experience of working with this age group, and her proven ability to combine contemporary theories of adolescent treatment with inventive and effective art expressions.</p></p><p>Practical and imaginative solutions to the multifaceted challenges that clinicians face when treating young peopleShirley Riley (1931-2004) was a registered art therapist and a licensed marriage and family counsellor in private practice.

Along with a broad array of canonical texts, Sarah Burns and John Davis have assembled an astonishing variety of unknown, little known, or undervalued documents to convey the story of American art through the many voices of its contemporary practitioners, consumers, and commentators. <i>American Art to 1900 </i>highlights such critically important themes as women artists, African American representation and expression, regional and itinerant artists, Native Americans and the frontier, popular culture and vernacular imagery, institutional history, and more. With its hundreds of explanatory headnotes providing essential context and guidance to readers, this book reveals the documentary riches of American art and its many intersecting histories in unprecedented breadth, depth, and detail.</p><p>&#x201c;This book is a breathtaking accomplishment. The rich and comprehensive collection of writings gathered by the editors reflects the expansive definition of American art history in the twenty-first century. Texts by canonical artists and critics are here, giving access to the texture of the aesthetic discussions of their historical moments. So are reflections by writers on the margins of the mainstream art world, including slaves, women and commercial artists, showing that they were equally interested in art and its relationship to society.&#x201d;&#x2015;Elizabeth Hutchinson, author of <i>The Indian Craze: Primitivism, Modernism</i>, and <i>Transculturation in American Art, 1890-1915</i><br><br>&#x201c;This eagerly anticipated compilation of historical subjects and sources will resonate for a diversity of scholars in the academy and the museum. Refreshingly inclusive, these judiciously selected documents prove the editors' assertion that words count by investing objects with layers of meaning and relevance.

The market is shell shocked and yesterday's momentum stocks are today's slow-motion stocks. But in the new reality of low-growth investing, commodities are hot and getting hotter. A rapidly industrializing and urbanizing Asia will be demanding lots more copper, zinc, iron ore, coal, fertilizers, gold and oil to transform their societies. Commodities are <i>it</i> and that's great news for investors who want to profit from the next great bull market in commodities. In fact, commodities may be about the only asset class that is likely to outperform the broad market in the future. <p>Although they are without a doubt important to the global economy, commodities are among the most misunderstood of all asset classes. Stocks, bonds and real estate all have legions of followers and plenty of experts agree on their importance within an investment portfolio, but venture into the world of commodities and you are into an area that's intimidating to the average investor, where suspicions run deep and understanding is limited. As a result, commodities get short-shrift in most investment accounts and investors miss out on some important opportunities.</p> <p><i>The Little Book of Commodity Investing</i> is an indispensible guide to learning the ins and outs of commodity investing. It's about identifying opportunities to profit from the coming bull market in commodities. It explains the benefits of commodities as part of a well diversified investment portfolio; covers all of the major commodities markets; what makes commodities and the companies that produce them tick; why commodities sometimes zig and then zag; what to buy and when to buy it; and why commodities are the next big thing.</p> <p>Today's world is a very different world-a world where an understanding of commodities is a prerequisite for investment success. And <i>The Little Book of Commodity Investing</i> is the roadmap you need to discover where the opportunities of the future lie, and what to do about it.</p></p><p>Your next, best investment opportunity isn't in stocks, bonds or real estate-it's in commodities, the basic raw materials of everyday life. Smart investors know that after a decade of decline, stocks aren't where the big money will be made. The winning bets of the future will be where global growth is <i>going, </i> rather than where it's been. <p>A rapid re-ordering of the global economic pecking order is underway, transforming the lives of millions and setting the stage for a massive bull market in commodities. Asia, led by China, is rising, and by 2020 the developing world is expected to be responsible for a staggering two-thirds of total global economic output. As millions of people around the world join the ranks of the global middle class, they'll be snapping up consumer items such as appliances and cars and underpinning an enormous demand for commodities. The economic strides made by the developing world so far have been breathtaking, but they're only just beginning. And that's a good news story for commodities.</p> <p>From cocoa to copper, the world of commodities is awash in opportunity. Yet commodities get short shrift in most investment portfolios despite the fact there are long stretches of time when commodities soar while stocks and bonds swoon. <i>This</i> is one of those times.</p> <p>Understanding commodities is a prerequisite for future investment success and <i>The Little Book of Commodity Investing</i> is an indispensable guide for investors-whether they're titans on Wall Street or retirees on Main Street-to the ins and outs of this hot sector, that will only get hotter. This practical guide covers: </p> <ul> <li>why commodities figure as part of <i>any</i> well diversified investment portfolio</li> <li>all major commodities and what makes the tick</li> <li>why commodities often zig when other investments zag</li> <li>why commodities are the next big thing.</li> </ul>Commodities are hot and getting hotter. Slumping supply and voracious demand haves set the stage for a massive bull market in the <i>real</i> things that you use every day. As global growth resumes, a powerful rallying cry for commodities is about to be heard around the world. <p>In simple, easy-to-understand language, John Stephenson shines a spotlight on commodities, exposing a world that is both fascinating and crucial to global economic progess. From the trading pits of Chicago to the streets of Shanghai, commodities figure in all of our lives. In <i>The Little Book of Commodity Investing,</i> Stephenson explains why commodities matter and how to profit in the commodity bull market that lies ahead.</p> <p>"Investors should look for ways to diversify their portfolios away from the current over-allocation to stocks. And one way to do that is through the world of commodity investing...Stephenson helps you work through the pitfalls and advantages."&#x2015;From the Foreword, by <b>John Mauldin</b></p></p><h2>College Admission&#x2014;How to Get Into Your Dream School: Real Students, Real Stories</h2><p><p><b>The trusted all-in-one resource for college admissions</b></p><p>Personal student stories and strategies of successful admissions to 40 of the nation's most outstanding universities.

And yet the outside world has long had a significant - and increasingly profound - impact on Niumi. This fascinating work shows how global events have affected people&#39;s lives over the past eight centuries in this small region in Africa&#39;s smallest country. Drawing on written and oral testimony, and writing in a clear and personal style, Donald R. Wright connects &#39;globalization&#39; with real people in a real place. This new edition updates discussions of global history and African history based on current studies and new developments that have been factored into the interpretive framework. Reflecting on recent visits to Niumi, Wright extends the story into 2009, to consider the impact of global recession and domestic political repression under a regime in power for the past fifteen years. Punctuating the narrative are photographs, maps, and &#39;Perspectives&#39; boxes on selected topics such as the sale of slaves five centuries ago, colonial sexism, the fate of press freedom, and how popular culture affects growing up in a traditional society. Throughout, the author deals with African history seriously, global trends critically, and human lives sensitively.</p><p><p><strong>Donald R.&nbsp;Wright</strong> is Distinguished Teaching Professor of History, Emeritus, at the State University of New York&#x2015;Cortland. His other books include two on early African American history, and a two-volume collection of oral traditions from The Gambia, and (as co-author) <i>The Atlantic World: A History </i>(2007).</p>&#34;It&#39;s really splendid to see this book reemerging in its new edition: it&#39;s the best combination of local sensitivity and global awareness I know of. The historical sweep is impressive, giving a sense of several major versions of global interaction. The updating about recent globalization is particularly welcome, but in this larger historical perspective. And the book is accessible to students, another obvious plus.&#34; - Peter N. Stearns, George Mason University; &#34;In revising and updating this work, Donald Wright has done the seemingly impossible: he has significantly improved what I have long considered the best teaching book on Africa. Extensively researched, analytic, and inter-disciplinary in approach, the book is equally suited for first-year World or African History surveys, upper level West African classes, and graduate courses on the Atlantic. Extensive interviews done in 2003 give a poignant immediacy to the book, and the photographs and maps match the text well, promoting further understanding among readers who are unfamiliar with the area.&#34; - Allen M.

Unicorn Humming Balls</b> <br><br>A humming ball is an energy created by mind focus, sound, and color, visualized between your hands. If you have ever made an angel humming ball, you will know how powerful and beautiful it is. A unicorn one is very similar, except that you create a pure white ball of light and as you hum, you mentally call in the unicorns. Putting your intention into an energy ball, while focusing sound and color into it, creates something potentially life changing. Invoking the unicorns at the same time makes it extraordinary. When you have made it you can send it to any person, place, or situation. <br><br>Here are some unicorn qualities you can place in your ball: love, peace, joy, integrity, faith, hope, dignity, serenity, tranquility, purity, wonder, awe, bliss, perseverance, patience, anticipation, and any other aspirations you can think of. <br><br><i><b>Making a unicorn humming ball</b></i> <br><br><b>1.</b> Decide on the unicorn qualities with which you want to fill the ball. <br><br><b>2.</b> Rub your hands together, then hold them a few inches apart so that you can feel the energy between them. Imagine there is a pure white ball of light between your palms. <br><br><b>3.</b> Tell the unicorns your intention for the humming ball, for example that you want to use it to send healing to a friend, peace into a situation, integrity to a business deal, or love to open the heart of someone who is hurt. <br><br><b>4.</b> Invite the unicorns to add their energy to your ball. 5. While focusing on the qualities and intention you are putting into your ball, hum into it, sensing it gently expand. <br><br><b>6.</b> Imagine your shimmering ball of unicorn light glowing in your hands. <br><br><b>7.</b> When you have finished ask the unicorns to take it to the person, place, or situation that you envisioned. <br><br><i><b>Two or more people making unicorn humming balls for each other</b><br></i><br>If you are with a friend, it is the most wonderful, caring, and nourishing thing to make a unicorn humming ball for each other. You can ask your friend what they would like in their ball. One might ask for the ball to be filled with peace and forgiveness, and then placed in their heart. Another might choose unicorn healing and purification for their liver, while another may seek strength and dignity to help them set up a school for deprived children. The possibilities are entirely up to the person who is receiving the ball. <br><br>Ask your friend what unicorn qualities they would like in their ball. They can choose several. Also ask them where they want the light to go, such as resolving a relationship, healing part of their body, improving their confidence, or to help with a mission. <br><br><i><b>Unicorn humming ball circle 1</b></i><br><br>This is based on the principle that it is in giving that we receive. The more you openheartedly give away love the more it flows into your life. <br><br>Sit or stand in a circle and make a unicorn humming ball for yourself. Place love or any other quality in it. When your hands are zinging with energy and unicorn blessings, place the ball in the heart of the person to your left. Receive one from whoever is on your right. Because you have created an outflow of love by giving your unicorn ball away, you can accept more into your life. <br><br><i><b>Unicorn humming ball circle 2</b></i> <br><br>Stand or sit in a circle with one person in the center. He or she may want to say what unicorn energies they would like to receive. Those in the ring make unicorn humming balls accordingly and then they have finished they place them into the individual in the center. It feels wonderful to receive! <br><br><i><b>Unicorn humming ball circle 3</b></i><br><br>Each person in the circle makes a humming ball. When they are ready they are passed lovingly and meaningfully to the person on your left. In this way each person is receiving and giving. As the unicorn balls go round the circle they gather energy. Finally they are all placed in the center. Now everyone can breathe in the unicorn energy full of love and intention, taking what they need. <br><br><b><i>Stories</i> </b><br><br>One lady had always wished to see unicorns but was not clairvoyant. During a unicorn workshop she asked that the unicorn humming ball being created for her go into her third eye with the intention of enabling her to see a unicorn. That very night she had a vivid dream in which her unicorn came to her. She could see it in all its shining glory and has never forgotten that moment. <br><br>One woman who was clairvoyant made a unicorn ball and sent it to her aunt. She was amazed to watch it flying through the ethers to her relative. It entered her body, spread through her like warm honey, then re-formed into a ball and flew back to the sender who was watching. It came into her heart and she felt a wonderful tingling cool sensation as the unicorn frequency vibrated there. <br><br><i><b>Abundance balloons</b> <br></i><br>I love to give and receive abundance balloons. And under the laws of the universe you open yourselves up to abundance too. As you hum into your balloon you are envisioning the recipient as if they have already received the riches, success, or wellbeing that you wish for them. <br><br>I have often seen angels taking abundance balloons up into the ethers to be energized by the universe. However, I was amazed to see a unicorn carrying an abundance balloon up into the higher realms for its contents to manifest. The unicorns tell me that they frequently take these balls of prayer directly to the higher kingdoms where they can precipitated into the material realms.</p><h2>Magellania</h2><p>Welcome Rain is proud to introduce this first English translation of Magellania, a unique, forceful novel that widens the scope of Verne&#39;s literary legacy and distinguishes itself in Verne&#39;s somber, philosophical questioning of society, religion, nature and man as he neared the end of his life.</p><p>Jules Verne (1828&#x2013;1905), the most translated author in the world, wrote numerous classics of adventure and science fiction, including <i>The Meteor Hunt</i>, <i>Lighthouse at the End of the World</i>, and <i>The Golden Volcano</i>, all available from the University of Nebraska Press.

However, in order to sustain this influence it has to adapt to the challenges of our current intellectual environment. This book attempts to build a bridge between psychoanalysis and a dominant perspective in modern psychiatry and psychology: developmental psychopathology. This perspective studies biological, psychological and social influences that act on individuals, shaping their pathways through life. While psychoanalytic perspectives are inherently developmental, this is often left implicit. This book highlights the developmental bases for psychoanalytic ideas, and examines their assumptions and claims in relation to observational and other data gathered within neighbouring disciplines. The book reaches back to the work of Freud, and covers North American and European ideas including the Klein-Bion model, the British Object Relations tradition, the work of Kernberg and Kohut as well as modern Relational Psychoanalysts.</p><p></p><h2>Landscape Design: A Practical Approach (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book provides a comprehensive view of the landscape design process&#x2014;offering professionals an ongoing education, the latest trends, and new design ideas. <b> </b> Its coverage includes design analysis, study of land forms and planning of land form manipulation, area creation and circulation, environmental adjustments, the aesthetics of good design, appropriate materials selection, bidding and estimating, and the proper use of enriching materials in the landscape. <b> </b> For landscape designers, architects, and salespeople. </p></p><p>The book allows the reader to bring the practical aspects of designing into the classroom everyday, preparing students for professional work in the field.<p> Written for horticulture and landscaping students and professional landscapers, <i>Landscape Design: A Practical Approach</i> will also serve as a valuable reference for landscape architects because of many practical applications. </p> <p> This comprehensive guidebook provides a good, basic understanding of the landscape design process, including: </p> <ul> <li>design analysis,</li> <li>study of land forms and planning of land form manipulation,</li> <li>area creation and circulation,</li> <li>environmental adjustments,</li> <li>aesthetics of good design,</li> <li>appropriate materials selection, and</li> <li>proper use of enriching materials in the landscape.</li> </ul> <p> Additionally, valuable materials covering specification reading and writing, bidding and estimating, and sales are included. </p> <p> You can't find another landscape designer's manual so chock-full of practical guidelines and handy techniques designed to put you at the forefront of your profession sooner than you thought possible! </p></p><h2>Martin Eden</h2><p>London recalls his own life as he recounts the story of Martin Eden, a young seaman struggling to obtain social and intellectual recognition as a writer</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

By combining the concerns of social history with an awareness for theological themes, this volume explores the history of this family of Lutheran churches and traces the development from the colonial era through the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1988. An introduction details the origins of Lutheranism in the European Reformation and the practices significant to the group's life in the United States. Organized chronologically, subsequent chapters follow the churches' maturation as they form institutions, provide themselves with leaders, and expand their membership and geographic range. Attention is given throughout to the contributions of the laity and women within the context of the Lutherans' continued individual and corporate effort to be both authentically Lutheran and genuinely American.</p><p></p><p>Offering a rich portrayal of the Lutherans' lives and their churches, the social historical approach of this study brings the Lutheran people to the foreground. The dynamic relationship between pietist, orthodox, and critical expressions of the tradition has remained among Lutherans even though they have divided themselves by several factors including ethnicity and confessional stance. Of interest to scholars and researchers of Lutheran history and religion in America, this engaging, multifaceted work balances narrative history with brief biographical essays. A chronological listing of important dates in the development of the Lutheran church is especially helpful.</p></p><p><p>A study of Lutheran history with increased attention to the activities and contributions made by the laity, by women, and by persons from outside the dominant ethnic groups.</p><p>L.

Cribb's comprehensive assessment describes a dangerous confluence of shortages--of water, land, energy, technology, and knowledge--combined with the increased demand created by population and economic growth. Writing in brisk, accessible prose, Cribb explains how the food system interacts with the environment and with armed conflict, poverty, and other societal factors. He shows how high food prices and regional shortages are already sending shockwaves into the international community. But, far from outlining a doomsday scenario, <i>The Coming Famine</i> offers a strong and positive call to action, exploring the greatest issue of our age and providing practical suggestions for addressing each of the major challenges it raises.</p><p>"Julian Cribb warns with a well synthesized evidence base about a potential famine in the making.

As such, it better fits into a modern graduate or undergraduate program in linguistics, cognitive science, or philosophy. Furthermore, since the technical tools it employs are much simpler to teach and to master, Knowledge of Meaning can be taught by someone who is not primarily a semanticist.Linguistic semantics cannot be studied as a stand-alone subject but only as part of cognitive psychology, the authors assert. It is the study of a particular human cognitive competence governing the meanings of words and phrases. Larson and Segal argue that speakers have unconscious knowledge of the semantic rules of their language, and they present concrete, empirically motivated proposals about a formal theory of this competence based on the work of Alfred Tarski and Donald Davidson. The theory is extended to a wide range of constructions occurring in natural language, including predicates, proper nouns, pronouns and demonstratives, quantifiers, definite descriptions, anaphoric expressions, clausal complements, and adverbs.Knowledge of Meaning gives equal weight to philosophical, empirical, and formal discussions. It addresses not only the empirical issues of linguistic semantics but also its fundamental conceptual questions, including the relation of truth to meaning and the methodology of semantic theorizing. Numerous exercises are included in the book.</p><p>Richard K.

Integrating a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives, Donald G. Dutton demonstrates that male abusiveness is more than just a learned pattern of behavior--it is the outgrowth of a particular personality configuration. He illuminates the development of the abusive personality from early childhood to adulthood and presents an evidence-based treatment approach designed to meet this population's unique needs. The second edition features two new chapters on the neurobiological roots of abusive behavior and the development of abusiveness in females.</p></p><p>Donald G. Dutton, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at the University of British Columbia. In 1979<b> </b>he cofounded the Assaultive Husbands Project, a court-mandated treatment program for men convicted of spousal assault. Dr. Dutton has published over 100 papers and four books, including <i>Domestic Assault of Women</i>; <i>The Batterer: A Psychological Profile</i>, which has been translated into French, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese, and Polish; and<i> Rethinking Domestic Violence</i>. He has frequently served as an expert witness in civil trials involving intimate abuse and in criminal trials involving family violence."Outstanding. Based on over 20 years of empirical literature and clinical experience, this second edition is a 'must read' for mental health professionals and researchers. Dutton goes beyond social stereotypes and superficial explanations to compassionately and eloquently describe the complex relationship among biological, developmental, psychological, and social factors contributing to the development of the abusive personality. With a solid foundation in the etiology of violent behavior, readers also learn about Dutton's highly effective perpetrator intervention program. The book will be accessible both to seasoned clinicians and to students, interns, and newly licensed professionals. What is most exciting and unique about this second edition is its incorporation of the most recent findings on neurobiology and attachment theory into a comprehensive theory of the development and treatment of the abusive personality."--Daniel J. Sonkin, PhD, private practice, Sausalito, California<br><br>"What sets this book apart from others is that Dutton goes to the core of partner violence by addressing individual psychopathology. He convincingly argues that abusive men have significant personality problems with origins in their early development, and he uses object relations and attachment theory to provide excellent clinical descriptions of how an individual becomes an abuser. This is important reading for any clinician or researcher interested in the psychology of battering."--K. Daniel O'Leary, PhD, Stony Brook University<br><br>"Dutton's formulations are the product of a first-rate scientific mind informed by decades of empirical research. He brings scientific rigor and intellectual clarity to his writing, which is both scholarly and compelling. With this second edition, Dutton solidifies his position as one of the world's most eminent domestic violence researchers."--Reid Meloy, PhD, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego&nbsp;"Dr. Dutton's outstanding work traces 20 years of empirical history examining partner violence from childhood to adulthood and then presents practical programs to meet the needs of patients suffering from abusive personality disorders. This book will not only appeal to the scholarly scientific mind of a well-seasoned therapist but will inform students just beginning in the field. The second edition has incorporated recent findings in neurobiology and developmental theory, which has been updated to include chapters on trauma research and abuse in females.

Our inborn emotions--anger and denial, but also relief and joy--help us deal effectively with loss. To expect or require only grief-stricken behavior from the bereaved does them harm.

This brief, accessible volume breaks new ground in its organization, emphasis on causation, and conclusions.</p><p>David Northrup was Professor of History at Boston College for four decades and has published widely in African, Atlantic, and world history. He is the co-author of <em>The Diary of Antera Duke: An Eighteenth-Century African Slave Trader</em> (2010); author of <em>Africa's Discovery of Europe, 1450-1850, Third Edition</em> (2013), <em>The Atlantic Slave Trade, Third Edition</em> (2011), and <em>Crosscurrents in the Black Atlantic, 1770-1965</em> (2007); and a contributor to the <em>Oxford Handbook on the Atlantic World, c. 1450-1820</em> (2009) and the <em>Oxford History of the British Empire</em> (1988, 2004).<p>'Northrup convincingly demonstrates that linguistic dominance is neither cause nor consequence of cultural, economic or political hegemony; rather, the rise of global English is a complex story involving interactions among them all, and stems as much from the individual decisions of the dominated as from the policies of the dominant. How English Became the Global Language is a stimulating and worthwhile read in its own right, but is also a model for interdisciplinary approaches to complex social phenomena.' - Survival</p> <p>"The global rise of English is a complex topic, and it deserves the kind of careful treatment found in Northrup's exceptional book. It will light the path for future studies of global English." - Muscat Daily</p> <p>"Languages spread as their speakers interact with other populations that become enticed or forced by various factors to learn and use them. They can travel long distances too, typically when they are associated with trans-territorial trade and/or colonial or imperial expansion. Bridging his expertise on colonial history with especially the ethnography of communication and the economics of language, David Northrup engages the reader in a very informative global account of the spread of English as the world's first truly 'global lingua franca.' An intellectually stimulating must-read for students of globalization and language, of language endangerment, and of world Englishes." - Salikoko S. Mufwene, The Frank J. McLoraine Distinguished Service Professor of Linguistics and the College, University of Chicago, USA</p> <p>"David Northrup presents a concise but broad and lively survey of the rise and spread of the English language over just under a millennium. A rather comprehensive introduction addresses disciplinary approaches to language, language history, layers of language, and shows how the English language got caught up in recent debates on imperialism.

This seems strange for a book that claims to be a revelation of Jesus Christ. But it doesn&#39;t have to be that way. In this concise reader&#39;s introduction, Revelation expert Ranko Stefanovic makes it all plain and simple, leading readers chapter by chapter, section by section, scene by scene through this amazing panorama of cosmic war and glory. And through it all, we see the astounding picture of a Creator God who wins it all with justice and love when Jesus Christ is plainly revealed as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p><p></p><h2>My Two Wars</h2><p>THERE ARE THOSE who consider the little-known Moritz Thomsen one of the best American writers of the century," said the <i>Washington Post</i> in reviewing <i>My Two Wars</i>. Thomsen here describes the two great battles in his life &#x2013; one against his rich, tyrannical father; the other against German pilots and anti-aircraft gunners in 1943 and 1944. Thomsen had an abiding hatred for his father, and with this portrait of the man he has given us one of literature&#x2019;s true monsters. "Rarely has the similarity between war and family been as clearly drawn as it is in this scathing unblinking memoir," said <i>Kirkus</i> in its starred review of the book. "Thomsen&#x2019;s writing about the war, both philosophical and descriptive, is stunning" said the <i>Post</i>.</p><p>Moritz Thomsen was born into a wealthy American family in Hollywood in 1915, but spent the last decades of his life living a mong the poor in Ecuador. He became known as a good writer with a small and devoted following. He passed away in 1993, but left behind this moving autobiography which focuses on the two colossal struggles of his life: one against a tyrannical father while seeking to escape his family and become a writer; the other against Hitler's Germany while serving as a bombardier on a B-17 of the fabled Eight Air Force. <b>My Two Wars</b> is an unusual and remarkable book, very much the reflection of an irascible but oddly charming man. <p> "I read <b>My Two Wars</b> in an elegiac mood. It's sad to think it's the last new work to be read by Moritz Thomsen... I've come away from each of his other four books feeling exhilarated -- not because of what happens in them, but because the writing is so good." -- Larry McMurtry</p>Moritz Thomsen&#39;s My Two Wars describes the great battles in his life - one against a rich, tyrannical father; the other against anti-aircraft gunners over Germany in 1943 and 1944. Thomsen was a gifted and original writer and a genuine American rebel. In his late-forties, he cast his lot with the poor, joined the Peace Corps, and was sent to Ecuador where he lived as an expatriate for the next twenty-eight years and chronicled his life in four remarkable books that have been compared with the work of Thoreau and Joseph Conrad. My Two Wars was completed shortly before Thomsen&#39;s death, and with it he concluded the story of his unusual life. In this final book he returns to his youth growing up in a wealthy Seattle household with the father he despised, and goes off to the war in Europe as a bombardier with the Eighth Air Force. Thomsen&#39;s writing about the war evokes Joseph Heller&#39;s famous novel in its poignancy and hilarity, and in his introduction Page Stegner calls it &#34;the best narrative account ever written of an imperfect and fragile human soul caught up in the air war over Germany&#34;. But it is Thomsen&#39;s other war - his lifelong and monumental battle with his father - which begins and ends the book and makes My Two Wars one of the most outrageous and memorable father-andson stories ever told. Even late in his life, long after his father&#39;s death, Thomsen can lament: &#34;I begin to write about him and find my body trembling with fifty year old angers. Old emotions still cramp my fingers; old injustices still march through my dreams&#34;.</p><h2>Interest Groups and Lobbying: Pursuing Political Interests in America</h2><p>Interest groups and lobbyists play a crucial role in how public policy is made in the United States' representative democracy. By helping citizens organize and pursue their self-interests in the political arena, interest groups and lobbyists are an alternative but very effective form of representation.

Leonardo was not content, however, to master an artistic technique or record the mechanics of a device; he was driven by an insatiable curiosity to understand why. His writings, interests, and musings are uniformly characterized by an incisive, probing, questioning mind. It was with this piercing intellectual scrutiny and detailed scientific thoroughness that Leonardo undertook the study of the human body.<br>This exceptional volume reproduces more than 1,200 of Leonardo's anatomical drawings on 215 clearly printed black-and-white plates. The drawings have been arranged in chronological sequence to display Leonardo's development and growth as an anatomist. Leonardo's text, which accompanies the drawings &#x2014; sometimes explanatory, sometimes autobiographical and anecdotal &#x2014; has been translated into English by the distinguished medical professors Drs. O'Malley and Saunders. In their fascinating biographical introduction, the authors evaluate Leonardo's position in the historical development of anatomy and anatomical illustration. Each plate is accompanied by explanatory notes and an evaluation of the individual plate and an indication of its relationship to the work as a whole.<br>While notable for their extraordinary beauty and precision, Leonardo's anatomical drawings were also far in advance of all contemporary work and scientifically the equal of anything that appeared well into the seventeenth century. Unlike most of his predecessors and contemporaries, Leonardo took nothing on trust and had faith only in his own observations and experiments. In anatomy, as in his other investigations, Leonardo's great distinction is the truly scientific nature of his methods. Herein then are over 1,200 of Leonardo's anatomical illustrations organized into eight major areas of study: Osteological System, Myological System, Comparative Anatomy, Nervous System, Respiratory System, Alimentary System, Genito-Urinary System, and Embryology.<br>Artists, illustrators, physicians, students, teachers, scientists, and appreciators of Leonardo's extraordinary genius will find in these 1,200 drawings the perfect union of art and science. Carefully detailed and accurate in their data, beautiful and vibrant in their technique, they remain today &#x2014; nearly five centuries later &#x2014; the finest anatomical drawings ever made.<br></p><p>Irma A.

Countless hours of planning and rehearsal go into preparing for our worship experiences with hundreds of volunteers donating thousands of hours to make it all happen.<br> Our team goes all out for these services. Original music. Dramatic live elements. Video presentations. Projection mapping. Creative lighting and sound effects. And I try to deliver the most powerful presentation of the gospel message I can. All of this&#x2014; from the technical elements to the proclamation of truth&#x2014;is executed with our best efforts. All for the greatest possible purpose&#x2014;to declare that Jesus is Lord over life and death and that God&#x2019;s grace is greater than our sin and shame.<br> Sure, I know Easter and Christmas have the reputation of being the times of the year when the &#x201c;nominal&#x201d; believers show up at a church service just to keep their Christian membership in good standing. But I think these holidays can also be times when God-seekers dare to venture out of the shadows, hoping to sample something supernatural. What&#x2019;s wrong with that, at least as a start? The spiritually curious are totally welcome at Elevation&#x2014;at Easter or on any given Sunday. And we&#x2019;ve been able to witness thousands of spiritually curious people become seriously devoted followers of Jesus during Easter worship experiences at Elevation. <br> My wife, Holly, and I and the rest of our original team started Elevation Church with the belief that vast numbers of people in our world are hungry to experience God. Some are far away from him, and they know it, so they&#x2019;re looking for a way to bridge the distance. Others have turned their lives over to Jesus, yet they real- ize their relationship with God isn&#x2019;t all it could be. It isn&#x2019;t growing. It doesn&#x2019;t measure up to the hopes they had at one time. They know there&#x2019;s got to be more to being in a relationship with God&#x2014;but how?<br> More of God. M.O.G. That&#x2019;s what people want&#x2014;whether they know it or not. Because it&#x2019;s what we all need.<br> Do you feel that hunger too?<br> If you do, that&#x2019;s a good thing. That hunger is the starting place of being filled with God&#x2019;s presence. But you don&#x2019;t have to look for God on your own&#x2014;wandering around aimlessly, frustrated and feeling like a failure. Instead, you can take your first step on a proven path to meeting God and knowing him better and better.<br> Let me warn you, however, this path isn&#x2019;t an easy one. It&#x2019;s riddled with difficulty and distress. But, if you&#x2019;re willing to take this journey with Jesus as both your companion and your destination, you will experience God&#x2019;s power in ways you didn&#x2019;t even know were possible. And while knowing it&#x2019;s going to be difficult may discourage you, don&#x2019;t let it. Easy isn&#x2019;t what you&#x2019;re called to. On this journey, fulfillment can never be measured in units of convenience and comfort.<br> This experience begins with both a map and a set of mile markers. First, the map. You&#x2019;ve got a seven-mile journey in front of you, my friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Resurrected and on the Road Again</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Imagine you&#x2019;re Jesus and it&#x2019;s Resurrection Sunday. In the early morning, you have come back to life and left your tomb. To mark the soul-shaking importance of this event, an earthquake has shaken the land. An angel has rolled aside the stone blocking your tomb&#x2019;s entrance, allowing some of your friends to peer in and see that you are gone. Meanwhile, perhaps you wander around the cemetery garden a bit all alone (the flowers smell great after you&#x2019;ve been dead for three days!). But soon you show yourself to Mary Magdalene and, a little later, to some of your disciples to let them know the incredible news that you are back.<br> So far, so good. But what do you do next?<br> Well, if you&#x2019;re Jesus, you go for a walk. The story is told in Luke 24:13&#x2013;35, and it provides us with our map&#x2014;a template or pattern, if you will&#x2014;for our spiritual journey in life.<br> According to the story, two of Jesus&#x2019;s followers heard early reports about the Resurrection but didn&#x2019;t take them seriously enough to let these reports alter their plans to leave Jerusalem and travel to the nearby town of Emmaus. One of these two followers was a guy named Cleopas. Who was the other one? We don&#x2019;t know because the story doesn&#x2019;t give us his or her name. There&#x2019;s a good chance, though, that this second person was Cleopas&#x2019;s wife. Apparently, they had a house in Emmaus and were going home after spending the Passover holiday in Jerusalem.<br> Whoever these two were, at one time they&#x2019;d no doubt had high hopes in Jesus. But after his death, it seemed like the show was over. They were still sure he&#x2019;d been a great man, an outstanding prophet even, but his death seemed to have put an end to their hopes that he would turn out to be the long-promised Messiah who would rescue Israel. As for the reports that Jesus had risen from the dead, that was just bizarre. Come on, to do that&#x2014;he&#x2019;d have to be divine!<br> These two didn&#x2019;t really get Jesus. And he took their misunderstanding so seriously that he spent a big piece of his first day back from the dead making sure they did get him. He&#x2019;d spent much of his ministry years traveling around Israel with his disciples, teaching them as he went, and now he went on the road again to show these two people who he was.<br> Another motive for Jesus going to Emmaus with Cleopas and Unnamed Follower #2 probably was that he wanted to keep his people corralled in Jerusalem for the time being.1 The departure of these two was the first sign that Jesus&#x2019;s squad was starting to scatter. So he wanted to head the travelers off at the pass. He wanted to put them back on the path to knowing him, just as he wants to put us back on the same path when we&#x2019;ve begun to stray.<br> Luke, who narrates this story, informs us that the town of Emmaus was sixty stadia, or about seven miles, from Jerusalem. That makes for about a two-hour walk. Jesus appeared at the side of these two people and asked if he could tag along with them.<br> Sure. Come along.<br> The strange thing is, Cleopas and his companion had no idea it was Jesus who joined them on their journey.<br> Why weren&#x2019;t these two followers of Jesus able to recognize him? Maybe because they weren&#x2019;t expecting to see him. After all, in their minds he was a corpse. Or maybe they didn&#x2019;t recognize him because he looked different after his resurrection. Maybe. But perhaps Jesus actually prevented them from recognizing him. Maybe he supernaturally interfered with the facial recognition software running in their brains&#x2014;because he had a big reveal in store for them shortly.<br> Let&#x2019;s be clear that Jesus wasn&#x2019;t just messing with the two travelers. He had a reason for concealing his identity. Cleopas and his companion didn&#x2019;t accept Jesus&#x2019;s real identity as the Son of God and Messiah, despite the things they&#x2019;d heard him say and the miracles they&#x2019;d seen him perform, and so it fit perfectly that now they didn&#x2019;t recognize his face either. They had eyes but failed to see, as Jesus described spiritual blindness on another occasion.2<br> So Jesus took over the conversation on the road, preaching a walking sermon and using the Hebrew Scriptures to explain that the Messiah had to die and be raised again. He started with Moses and ended with Malachi, putting the Word of God (at least so far as it related to himself) in a new light for them.<br> As a preacher, I work hard to make sure the truths that I&#x2019;ve discovered connect with people in meaningful ways. I love when I see that people are nodding along, shouting amen, or even crying, because these can be indications that God&#x2019;s Word is connecting with their hearts.<br> I&#x2019;m in awe of the effect Jesus&#x2019;s preaching had in his two followers because the story tells us that their hearts burned within them while Jesus explained what the Hebrew Scriptures foretold about him.3 They felt like they were on fire inside! Jesus&#x2019;s words burned up their old preconceived notions about the Messiah and lit a fire of hope and new understanding within them. They were catching on to God&#x2019;s plan to redeem all things through the sacrifice of his Son, and it was amazing!<br> These two were starting to get the picture of who Jesus really was. But they still didn&#x2019;t connect it all with the man who was talking to them.<br> At the end of their journey, the two travelers finally did realize who the man walking beside them was. I&#x2019;m going to tell that part of the story when we get to Mile 7. But for now I want us to think about that journey as the pair gradually came to understand Jesus better, ending in a miraculous vision of the risen Lord. Why&#x2019;s it important to us? Because this is the journey we need to take in our lives. Like those two people on the road that day, you and I have got to walk with Jesus, learning from him, observing his ways, and more and more seeing him in his greatness.<br> We&#x2019;ve all got a seven-mile road of our own to travel.<br><br> <b>The Jesus Highway<br></b><br> Jesus was a walker. Throughout his ministry years, Jesus gathered his team around him and then crisscrossed the country. Some- times he headed toward towns and villages where people needed his words and his touch. Sometimes he headed away from people, because he needed to get alone with his Father and pray. Some- times he stopped by Jerusalem for one of the big religious festivals. Sometimes he had strange appointments in out-of-the-way places that nobody else knew anything about (a woman of low morals in Samaria, a demon-possessed man in Gerasa, for instance).<br> The disciples had to have wondered how Jesus came up with his itinerary. And maybe Google sync could have helped them get their calendars synchronized with his agenda. But whether or not they understood what was going on at any given time, they went along with him. You see, they knew who they were:<br> Followers.<br> Jesus&#x2019;s first words of calling to his disciples were really simple: &#x201c;Follow me.&#x201d;4 He wanted them to come along with him and pick things up from him as he went about his business. And so that&#x2019;s what they did. They followed Jesus, both literally and metaphorically, for the duration of his ministry on earth.<br> Eventually, at the Last Supper, Jesus told the disciples, &#x201c;Where I am going, you cannot follow now.&#x201d;5 He was going to the cross alone. So for once these men would have to wait while Jesus went on ahead without them. It must have been disorienting for them. They were used to following Jesus. They wanted to keep following Jesus. For now, they could only follow so far.<br> But then Jesus added, &#x201c;You will follow later.&#x201d; They would re- join him for a few precious weeks after his resurrection. Then, for the rest of their lives, they would learn to follow his example and leading through the Holy Spirit. In fact, after spreading the word about Jesus far and wide, most of them would become martyrs for his cause. That is, they would follow him all the way to death&#x2019;s door . . . and through it. They would follow him all the way to heaven.<br> Let me show you why this is all significant for us.<br> One morning after Jesus was resurrected, he was having breakfast with the disciples&#x2014;the original Breakfast Club. This was the setting where he and Peter had the legendary conversation in which Jesus said &#x201c;Do you love me?&#x201d; three times. After Peter assured Jesus three times that he did love him, and after Jesus told Peter three times to &#x201c;feed my lambs,&#x201d; Jesus said this to Peter: &#x201c;Follow me.&#x201d;6<br> At the beginning of their earthly story together, it was &#x201c;Follow me.&#x201d; At the end it was &#x201c;Follow me&#x201d; too. It seems that following was the basic condition for being one of Jesus&#x2019;s people.<br> And it&#x2019;s not just the original disciples who are Jesus&#x2019;s followers. <br> When Jesus gave his Great Commission with the word go, he turned us all into people who are to navigate the surface of the planet in obedience to his calling. We&#x2019;re never alone in doing this. He&#x2019;s right there by our side. We&#x2019;ve got Jesus with us &#x201c;to the very end of the age.&#x201d;7<br> So we&#x2019;re not just to be believers&#x2014;people who have put our faith in Jesus. We&#x2019;re not just to be disciples&#x2014;pupils who learn from him. We&#x2019;re not just to be Christians&#x2014;those who are known by his name. We&#x2019;re also to be followers.<br> Jesus said, &#x201c;Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny them- selves and take up their cross and follow me.&#x201d;8 Like sheep who hear the voice of a shepherd we know and trust, we follow him.9<br> Our spiritual journey is not one we take by striking out on our own. We&#x2019;re following in the footsteps of someone else&#x2014;Jesus. He&#x2019;s our trailblazer. He has gone ahead of us in life as a human being, and he has gone ahead to heaven to prepare a place for us there.10<br> But Jesus is not just our trailblazer; he&#x2019;s also the trail itself! <br> When Jesus announced he was going away (to heaven),<br> Thomas said to him, &#x201c;Lord, we don&#x2019;t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?&#x201d;11<br> Jesus answered, &#x201c;I am the way.&#x201d;12 He&#x2019;s a path, a road, a way.<br> To elaborate, he said, &#x201c;No one comes to the Father except through me.&#x201d; A journey with Jesus, it turns out, is the only way to truly have more of God.<br> The apostle Paul understood this. He had a hunger for M.O.G., saying, &#x201c;I want to know Christ&#x2014;yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.&#x201d;13 That&#x2019;s exactly what we&#x2019;re doing in Seven- Mile Miracle: following Jesus through his death and into his resurrection so that we can be like him.<br> Paul was totally determined to keep going. He said, &#x201c;Forget- ting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&#x201d;14<br> Straining forward. Pressing on.<br> Reaching toward.<br> We&#x2019;ll make it to our destination if we keep going and do not stop. The way has already been made.<br><br> <b>Famous Last Words</b><br> &nbsp;<br> I hate exercising, but I do it because I feel like I&#x2019;m supposed to. I work out with other people to make sure I keep going. One of the guys I work out with likes to do timed exercises and thinks it&#x2019;s really clever not to tell me how much time we have left on an exercise. He just tells me when we&#x2019;re done.<br> I told him one day, &#x201c;From now on, I need you to give me some mile markers, because I need some encouragement when I&#x2019;m in the middle of the exercise. Tell me, &#x2018;Halfway there,&#x2019; even if I&#x2019;m not halfway. Lie to me. Just tell me what you need to tell me to keep me going for another rep, because I can&#x2019;t just be doing this and not know how much longer I have left.&#x201d;<br> Wouldn&#x2019;t it be great if we had a time clock or some mile markers to tell us where we are on our journey with God&#x2014;and how much further we have to go? To my knowledge, no such definitive measurement of progress exists. But for this seven-mile journey we&#x2019;re beginning together, we&#x2019;re going to mark our miles with the statements Jesus made on the cross.<br> There&#x2019;s something about people&#x2019;s last words uttered in this life that inspire our curiosity or cause us to treat them as especially weighty.

Yet so compelling is the notion, we would do almost anything to attain such bliss. It is the tension and instinctive drama of this age-old quest that David Drebin chronicles in his latest work--aptly titled, <i>Chasing Paradise</i>. These skillfully arranged scenarios convey the thrill of deeply illicit adventures. We find ourselves intrigued, yet also slightly concerned by the risks. Set against distinctive backdrops, Drebin's models seem to occupy a supernatural state of being. Powerful and all-knowing, each one has the mystery of a mythical figure--upon whose loveliness we mortals can only hope to gaze. Drebin seduces us with every twist and turn of his darkly sensual narratives. Never before has temptation seemed so tantalizing--or so worth pursuing.</p><p>Internationally exhibited in the finest galleries, New York-based David Drebin is known for his sensual storytelling. His compositions are almost cinematic in their ability to convey plotlines and emotions at a glance--happiness, humor, and sometimes melancholy.</p><h2>Raptors of the World (Princeton Field Guides, 39)</h2><p><p>This new field guide covers all of the world's kites, vultures, harriers, hawks, buzzards, eagles, and falcons.</p><br><p> Based on essential sections of the widely acclaimed handbook <i>Raptors of the World</i> by the same authors, but with updated text, maps, and plates, it shows every species in a selection of different plumages, with concise facing texts and distribution maps.</p><br><p> It provides an easy-to-use and portable reference to one of the world's largest, most popular, and most challenging avian groups.</p><p> </p><ul><br> <li> A unique identification guide to all the world's raptors </li><br> <li> 118 color plates show 338 species in flight and perched </li><br> <li> Facing text summarizes size, confusion species, habitat, and behavioral and plumage differences </li><br> <li> Color distribution maps included for every species </li><br> <li> Ideal for use in the field, anywhere in the world</li><br> </ul><p></p></p><p><b>James Ferguson-Lees</b> has been Editor of <i>British Birds</i>, President of the British Trust for Ornithology, a Committee Chairman and Deputy Director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and a Council Member and Records Committee Chairman of the British Ornithologists' Union.

Christie</b> is Assistant Editor of <i>British Birds</i>. He is coauthor of a number of books, including the award-winning <i>Woodpeckers</i>.Prepared with the same grace that raptors possess, this is an impressive opus. As the first major entry in the publisher's "Helm Identification" series in many years, it is of course intended for identification. But even Ferguson-Lees, deputy director of the Royal Society for Bird Preservation, and Christie, assistant editor of British Birds, realize that given its heft this volume may be used more as a reference than as a field guide. To narrow identification choices, birders can carry a smaller guide suited to their current locale, such as David Allen Sibley's recent The Sibley Guide to Birds (LJ 11/1/00), and then consult this work later for further help. All 313 species of diurnal raptors (excluded are the nocturnal owls) are illustrated in color and black and white, perched and in flight. As with any field guide, information is provided for identification, including brief descriptive text next to the color plate, illustrations of juvenile and adult plumage, and a range map. Reference text about each species describes distribution (with a larger map), movements, habitat, field characters, perched and flight characteristics, confusion species, voice, food, sociosexual behavior, breeding, population, variations, size measurements, and references. An index and a colossal 50-page bibliography conclude the work. The plate color is good, and the images are clear. A required purchase for every ornithology collection, academic or public, this book is highly recommended.DNancy Moeckel, Miami Univ.

Stanton. Perhaps the most bizarre unit organized by the Union, the rams were shunned by both the army and navy as superfluous instruments of war. However, on June 6, 1862, they proved their worth by defeating the Confederate River Defense Fleet ironclads at Memphis while the U.S. Navy simply watched. In this lively study, Chester G. Hearn details the formation and wartime exploits of Ellet's fleet, reviving the history of this fascinating but forgotten brigade.</p></p><p><p>Chester G.

Tea and sugar, the fruits of British mercantile and colonial expansion, altered their diets. Pendulum clocks and Staffordshire pottery, the products of British manufacturing ingenuity, enriched their homes. But it was in their clothing that ordinary people enjoyed the greatest change in their material lives. This book retrieves the unknown story of ordinary consumers in eighteenth-century England and provides a wealth of information about what they wore.</p><p>John Styles reveals that ownership of new fabrics and new fashions was not confined to the rich but extended far down the social scale to the small farmers, day laborers, and petty tradespeople who formed a majority of the population.

Flight-Lieutenant David Heron, home on convalescent leave, awakes to the news that a murder victim has been discovered in the garden of his boarding house. With a week until his service resumes, David sets out to solve the murder. Drawn into a world of mystery and double-dealing, he soon realises that there is more to the inhabitants of the boarding house than meets the eye, and that wartime London is a place where opportunism and the black market are able to thrive. Can he solve the mystery before his return to the skies?

Both Rortian pragmatism, which draws the consequences of post-war developments in Anglo-American philosophy, and Derridian deconstruction, which extends and troubles the phonomenological and Heideggerian influence on the Continental tradition, have hitherto generally been viewed as mutually exclusive philosophical language games.<br>The purpose of this volume is to bring deconstruction and pragmatism into critical confrontation with one another through staging a debate between Derrida and Rorty, itself based on discussions that took place at the <em>College International de Philosophie</em> in Paris in 1993. The ground for this debate is layed out in introductory papers by Simon Critchley and Ernesto Laclau, and the remainder of the volume records Derrida's and Rorty's responses to each other's work. Chantal Mouffe gives an overview of the stakes of this debate in a helpful preface.</p><p>Derridean deconstruction and Rortian pragmatism are both accused by their enemies of undermining our ideas of truth and reason, but do their ideas lead to intellectual and political chaos? Both are committed to the democratic project but they reject the necessary link between universalism, rationalism and modern democracy and seek to clarify what is at stake intellectually and politically.Chantal Mouffe is a Research Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Democracy at the University of Westminster.

Many species have now had their genomes sequenced, and molecular techniques allow genetic inspection of even non-model organisms. But as longtime <i>Nature</i> editor Henry Gee argues in <i>Across the Bridge</i>, despite these giant strides and our deepening understanding of how vertebrates fit into the tree of life, the morphological chasm between vertebrates and invertebrates remains vast and enigmatic.<br> <br> As Gee shows, even as scientific advances have falsified a variety of theories linking these groups, the extant relatives of vertebrates are too few for effective genetic analysis. Moreover, the more we learn about the species that do remain&#x2014;from sea-squirts to starfish&#x2014;the clearer it becomes that they are too far evolved along their own courses to be of much use in reconstructing what the latest invertebrate ancestors of vertebrates looked like. Fossils present yet further problems of interpretation. Tracing both the fast-changing science that has helped illuminate the intricacies of vertebrate evolution as well as the limits of that science, <i>Across the Bridge</i> helps us to see how far the field has come in crossing the invertebrate-to-vertebrate divide&#x2014;and how far we still have to go.</p></p><p><b>Henry Gee</b> is a senior editor at <i>Nature</i> and the author of such books as <i>Jacob&#x2019;s Ladder</i>, <i>In Search of Deep Time</i>, <i>The Science of Middle-earth</i>, and, most recently, <i>The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution</i>, the last published by the University of Chicago Press. He lives in Cromer, Norfolk, England, with his family and numerous pets.&#x201c;An excellent addition, complementing Gee&#x2019;s earlier book <i>Before the Backbone</i>, which provided an historical perspective on ideas surrounding vertebrate origins. Gee addresses an important topic for biologists and zoologists about vertebrates&#x2019; place in the &#x2018;grand scheme.&#x2019; We are familiar with vertebrates, or think that we are. However, Gee shows beautifully, as a group we are just as strange in many ways as other groups appear to us. <i>Across the Bridge</i> takes on a very esoteric subject and is genuinely witty and charming. The book really is magnificent.&#x201d; (Neil J. Gostling, University of Southampton)</p><h2>The Nature and Functions of Law (University Textbooks)</h2><p>This book focuses on the special character of law in performing certain social functions including resolving disputes, maintaining historical continuity and doctrinal consistency, protecting and facilitating voluntary arrangements, and resolving acute social conflict. The text presents aspects of criminal and civil procedure; judicial reasoning on the basis of precedents (focusing on manufacturers&#x2019; liability in tort); the law of contracts; and labor, race, and gender laws to test the success of the legal system in carrying out these basic purposes. Includes American and comparative and international law materials. <br></p><p>Emory &amp; Henry College</p><h2>Critical Race Theory: Cases, Materials and Problems (University Casebook)</h2><p>This text does a number of things that no other Critical Race Theory casebook does. First, it applies the case method approach. Not an anthology, it examines cases through the analytical framework of Critical Race Theory. Second, in order to appeal to the broadest number of students, the casebook examines cases in the first year curriculum. There is a separate chapter on Torts, Contracts, Criminal Procedure, Criminal Law and Sentencing, Property and Civil Procedure. Third, it examines cases where race is not always obvious, showing how race is often relevant even where it may initially appear not to be relevant. Fourth, it provides cases where the courts have applied a Critical Race Theory perspective.</p><p></p><h2>The Book about Xu Bing&#39;s Book from the Ground (MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>The creation of Xu Bing's Book from the Ground documented and described in text, images, and photographs. </b></p><p>Although the pictogram-only narrative in Xu Bing's <i>Book from the Ground</i> can be read by anyone, there is much more to the story of Xu Bing's wordless book than can be gleaned from icons alone. This companion volume to <i>Book from the Ground </i>chronicles the entire project, mapping the history of Xu Bing's novel creation from inspiration to exhibition to publication.</p><p>In the 1980s, Xu Bing created <i>Book from the Sky</i>. Using garbled and nonsensical faux-Chinese characters, this installation expressed Xu's doubts about written language and provoked questions about the Chinese language. Thirty years later, with <i>Book from the Ground</i>, the artist expresses his hope for a single, universally understood language. Inspired by airport signs that communicate instantaneously through images&#x2015;directing a temporary community of modern nomads where to eat, shop, sit, and find a bathroom&#x2015;Xu began to collect images, icons, and logos from which he could construct a story.

He does not duck the realities in today&#x2019;s schools and classrooms.&nbsp;He provides clear guidance for putting professional integrity and emotional literacy into practice from early, minimal&nbsp;intervention&nbsp;to responding to the most difficult student and the most challenging situation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Every teacher needs this book, and every student needs them to have read it.</p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> Author: Sue Roffey<br><br>Now in its third edition, Classroom Behaviour owes much of its success to the realism of its scenarios and case studies, and the lessons and advice that the author draws from them. He gives us forensic deconstruction and analysis, often with dialogue, of every conceivable classroom issue, challenge and potential crisis. There is much on language - tone, choice of words, and body language - reminding us just how easily we can undermine our intentions by the way we convey them. This new edition has additional material on bullying, teaching autism spectrum disorder children in mainstream schools, and working with challenging students. Author: Gerald Haigh<br><br>The scenarios are real and relatable, the feelings and reflections honest, and the problem-solving strategies and interventions realistic. All teachers, teacher-researchers, professional leaders, and educationalists will benefit from contemplating and putting into practice the suggestions and guidance in this book and their students and colleagues may thank them too.

Because it is easy to observe everywhere, even in big cities, it is a prime target for aspiring astronomers and for those who are merely curious about the night sky. This easy-to-use guide to discovering lunar sites takes the reader through fourteen observing sessions from New Moon to Full Moon. For each evening, the book shows which craters, mountains and other features can be seen, and how to find them. Each photograph shows what the observer actually sees through a telescope, solving the usual difficulties of orientation confronting beginners. Images are shown as they appear through both refracting and reflecting telescopes. Maps printed on the book&#39;s front and back flaps show the whole Moon with sites as seen through a refractor, through a Newtonian reflector, or, when turned upside-down, through binoculars. Jean Lacroux has been a columnist for the French astronomy magazine Ciel et Espace for 25 years. He has published four successful amateur astronomy books in French.

Opening with world statistics and a colorful 48-page Introduction to World Geography--beautifully illustrated with tables and graphs--this acclaimed resource provides details on such topics as climate, the greenhouse effect, global warming, plate tectonics, agriculture, population and migration, and global conflicts. As in years past, the Fourteenth Edition includes a wealth of new geographic information, including a new flag for Lesotho, the addition of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union, a new region in Senegal and two provinces in Ecuador, plus the addition of national parks such as Lake Shkoder National Park in Montenegro and New Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park on the border of South Africa and Mozambique.

The answer depends upon your library's audience. The Hammond has a slightly higher percentage of maps of North America, the Oxford of Europe. The Hammond devotes more space to matters like "interpreting maps"; the Oxford has more pages of indexes plus a 32-page section of city maps. The Hammond atlas is the first such atlas to be generated completely from computer databases (it took five years and $5 million); the Oxford depends on the tried-and-true skills of the George Philip Group. The Oxford shows relief by hypsometric tints, the Hammond by color, shaded relief, and spot heights. They are both good buys, so if your users are oriented toward the United States and your map library has a good collection of large-city maps, try the Hammond; if Euro-centered, buy Oxford.<br><i>- Mary L.

Born and raised in an idyllic but racially divided town that later became the scene of South Carolina's horrific Orangeburg Massacre, Speth explores how the civil rights movement and the South's agrarian roots shaped his later work in the heyday of the environmental movement, when he founded two landmark environmental groups, fought for the nation's toughest environmental laws, spearheaded programs in the United Nations, advised the White House, and moved into a leading academic role as dean of Yale's prestigious School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Yet, in the end, he arrived somewhere quite unexpected&#x2013;still believing change is possible, but not within the current political and economic system. Throughout this compelling memoir, Speth intertwines three stories&#x2013;his own, his hometown's, and his country's&#x2013;focusing mainly on his early years and the lessons he drew from them, and his later years, in which he comes full circle in applying those lessons. In the process he invites others to join him politically at or near the place at which he has arrived, wherever they may have started.</p></p><p><p>James Gustave "Gus" Speth is the former dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, founder and president of the World Resources Institute, and cofounder of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He has also been administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, chair of the U.N. Development Group, professor of law at Georgetown University, and chair of the U.S. Council on Environmental Quality in the Carter administration. He currently teaches at Vermont Law School, and is a senior fellow at the Democracy Collaborative where he is co-chair of the Next System Project. He is also distinguished senior fellow with Demos, associate fellow with the Tellus Insitute, and the recipient of numerous environmental awards. His previous books include&nbsp;<em>America the Possible: Manifesto for a New Economy</em>, and the award-winning&nbsp;<em>The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability</em> and&nbsp;<em>Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment</em>.</p><p>"I have been fortunate to know this remarkable man, and now readers can, too. I urge you to accompany Gus Speth through his early life in the segregated South, the liberal North, the heady days of the environmental movement and his disenchantment with inside-the-system fixes. You will find the journey engrossing, eye opening, inspiring, and deeply moving.&#x201d;<strong>--Juliet Schor, co-founder of the Center for a New American Dream and author of <em>True Wealth</em></strong></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Kirkus Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>"Speth&#x2015;the former dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council and World Resources Institute&#x2015;tells of his nearly idyllic boyhood in segregated Orangeburg, South Carolina, in the 1940s and 1950s, of his awakening to the evils of racism in the 1960s&#x2015;he was away at Yale Law School during the infamous Orangeburg Massacre of 1968&#x2015;and of his growing awareness of the power of social movements. He chronicles how he poured his youthful energy into environmental advocacy because he believed that he 'had largely missed one great American struggle, civil rights, and...did not want to miss another.' The author writes modestly of his distinguished career, explaining the jobs he held and the ones he didn't get, offers generous praise to those who taught him and helped him along the way, and gives a nod to the role played by sheer good luck. Beyond the biographical data, though, Speth is using his memoir to send a message developed in his earlier books:<em> Red Sky at Morning, The Bridge at the Edge of the World</em> and <em>America the Possible.</em> The author pulls no punches in charging that the environmental movement, working within the system, is facing failure, and he asserts that lack of leadership on the issue of climate change 'is probably the greatest dereliction of civic responsibility in the history of the Republic.' In Speth's view, the only option left is to change our political economy from one that gives top priority to profit, production and power to one that values people, place and planet. Both a personal account of a long career dedicated to the environment and a fervent plea for major reform.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><em>"Angels by the River </em>does what the best memoirs hope to do&#x2015;launch the reader into a larger collective story.

While guiding us through the remarkable currents of his life, Gus Speth thrills us with the breadth of his thinking and the depths of his insights. His voice is absolutely essential when it comes to the environment. And he is never less than compelling as he makes the case for transformational change on any number of other important issues, from our obsession with economic growth to US policy in the Middle East."<strong>--Bob Herbert, distinguished senior fellow at Demos and former Op-Ed columnist for the <em>New York Times</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"<em>Angels by the River</em> is a personal look at the forces that shaped one of America&#x2019;s great environmental leaders and climate activists. Gus doesn&#x2019;t shy away from the dangers of climate change, but he maintains an enduring faith that people can and will make the difference.

It traces the history of fashion studies and provides readers with a guided introduction to the entire research process.

Using case studies, the author outlines the major issues and methodological strategies that researchers employ, and examines the range of approaches in the field. Fashion, the author demonstrates, can be treated as a material object, an abstract idea, a social phenomenon, a system, a cultural value or an attitude among many other approaches.

Robert Oppenheimer: And the American Century</h2><p>J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who led the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb and ended World War II, forged the alliance between science and government that made the American Century possible. David C. Cassidy's biography is not merely the life story of a brilliant physicist, it tells the hidden story of the political and social forces shaping the world in our time: the rise of American science.<br>Oppenheimer, the eldest son of an aristocratic Jewish family living on the Upper West Side of New York City, attended the secular, progressive, and elite Ethical Culture School. Cassidy, building his narrative on previously untapped primary documents, shows the importance and character of Oppenheimer's early education. The liberal values he absorbed there ran counter to the culture he found at Harvard, whose president sought to foster a future managerial elite, the rulers of the new American society. These formative contrasts in values explain Oppenheimer's many seeming contradictions. Why did the scientist who correctly theorized black holes turn his back on cutting edge research? How did a gentle liberal humanist become responsible for the creation of the first real weapon of mass destruction? How could a brilliant mind like his virtually found "scientific militarism" and then let it destroy him?<br>Cassidy opens up a life story that is emblematic of the transformation of America over the last three generations. It offers, as the best history can, an insight into the future technological and moral progress of a nation.</p><p><p>"David Cassidy has done it again. Employing the insight and skill that made his Heisenberg biography so widely read and honored, Cassidy's new book breaks new ground, by explaining Oppenheimer's rise and fall as an important part of the social, cultural, and political turmoil of America's twentieth-century."</p><p>&#x2014;Gerald Holton, Mallinckrodt Research Professor of Physics and Research Professor of the History of Science, Harvard University</p><p> "Cassidy presents a comprehensive and engaging account of the life of J.

Cassidy presents an informative, thoughtful, and very readable biography of this important, complex individual. In addition he has succeeded in giving an insightful, convincing account of Oppenheimer's actions by placing his life and work in the context of the scientific militarism that was to provide the United States with some of the means to guarantee its security&#x2014;a militarism that Oppenheimer helped shape and that eventually crushed him.

Robert Oppenheimer, the leader of the Manhattan Project and one of the most complex and seemingly contradictory individuals of the twentieth-century."</p><p>--Gregory Tarle, Professor of Physics, University of Michigan</p><p>J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who led the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb and ended World War II, forged the alliance between science and government that made the American Century possible. David C. Cassidy's much anticipated, richly detailed, magisterial biography is not merely the life story of a brilliant physicist, it tells the hidden story of the political and social forces shaping the world in our time: the rise of American science.</p><p>In 1941, before Germany failed to build an atomic weapon, and the United States succeeded, <i>Life</i> published Henry R. Luce's essay "The American Century." It proclaimed that America was not at war simply to defeat the Axis powers. The United States must "exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purpose as we see fit and by such means as we see fit." Cassidy reveals such confidence, and the success of the Manhattan Project itself, were essentially by products of the rise of American science driven by burgeoning industrial prosperity and a kind of national devotion to the pursuit of knowledge. While Cassidy illuminates Oppenheimer's genius for inspiring his students and colleagues to attack and ultimately solve the hardest scientific problems of the age, he also takes the reader to the 1954 Atomic Energy Commission Security review that disgraced Oppenheimer, stripped him of his security clearance for alleged "red ties," and captured headlines across the nation. Documents that have only recently come to light regarding those ties are thoroughly and conclusively examined.</p><p>Oppenheimer, the eldest son of an aristocratic Jewish family living on the Upper West Side of New York City, attended the secular, progressive, and elite Ethical Culture School.

Whether one is in harmony with the world or not depends upon one's relative emotional and spiritual health. For this reason, the core teachings of Buddhism have always emphasized various forms of mind training. In <i>Transforming the Mind</i>, based on an edited series of his lectures, the Dalai Lama provides a succinct overview of the basic techniques of spiritual development in Tibetan Buddhism. He introduces several aspects of mind training, combining the insights of traditional scholarship with his personal warmth and humanity.<p> The book begins with a lucid account of the basic teachings of Buddhism--the nature of the human predicament and how it can be overcome. Then two key aspects of mind training involving the development of altruism and insight are described. This is essential, since Buddhism teaches that true mental transformation requires a sense of responsibility for others, together with the attainment of insight into the dynamic working of the human psyche and the world. Included in the book is the short traditional text on mental transformation, which the Dalai Lama used to structure his illuminating presentation of Buddhist practice. As an added bonus, the book concludes with a message for the millennium, giving the Dalai Lama's views on the role of Buddhist-inspired ethics in this newly dawning era.</p><p> Though not aimed at complete beginners, this book will appeal to readers who are seriously committed to bringing about change in the world through developing their own spiritual capabilities, whether they are Buddhists or not. <i>--Stephen Hodge, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the exiled spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1989. He is the author of many books about Buddhism. He lives in Dharamsala, India.</p><h2>Veterinary Parasitology</h2><p>This study provides comprehensive coverage of all aspects of parasitic disease in domestic animals from both temperate and topical zones. The book deals with all three aspects of parasitology - helminthology, entomology and protozoology - and blood-borne rickettsial infections. It systematically reviews: epidemiology; immunity; anthelmintics; ecoparasiticides; and laboratory diagnosis. The book should be of interest to veterinary students studying parasitology, practising veterinarians and those directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitic infections of domestic animals.</p><p></p><h2>The Bible and Its Influence, Student Text (Bible Literacy Project) (Bible Literacy Project)</h2><p>The student textbook is a hardcover, full-color, 387-page volume that covers the content of Genesis to Revelation. It is described as a feast for the eyes for its spectacular beauty and contains some of the world s most famous art, as well as sidebar features on how the Bible has influenced literature, poetry, music, art, history, public rhetoric, and Western civilization. Special one-or two-page features include Abraham Lincoln and the Bible, Handel s Messiah, The Bible and Emancipation, Shakespeare and the Bible, plus many more. The textbook was edited by Cullen Schippe, vice-president and publisher for Music, Religion, and Social studies at Macmillan/McGraw-Hill and Chuck Stetson, founder and chairman of the Bible Literacy Project. The book was examined prior to publication by 40 reviewers, with their feedback incorporated into the editing of the text.</p><p>The first complete textbook in nearly 30 years for high school academic study of the Bible is coming soon. Thoroughly reviewed and critically acclaimed, it respects the views of major faith groups, while endorsing none.Why Study the Bible? <br> For millions of people the Bible is seen as sacred scripture. It is believed by many Jews and Christians to contain God&#x2019;s revelation&#x2014;an inspired communication from the divine to the human. This scripture has been influencing people for thousands of years. That influence extends not only to the synagogue or to the church. It is felt in the language people speak. It is experienced, too, in much of the art, music, and literature of Western culture. The Bible has influenced law and politics as well. And in the United States, the Bible&#x2014;its characters, narratives, teachings, and the like&#x2014;have played an important role in American history and culture. If your name is Joshua or David or Michael, Mary or Elizabeth or Sarah, Zeke or Deb or Sam or Sue, your name has its source in the Bible. If you have read William Golding&#x2019;s Lord of the Flies, John Steinbeck&#x2019;s East of Eden, or John Milton&#x2019;s Paradise Lost, you have read works inspired in part or as a whole by the Bible. If you have watched Francis Ford Coppola&#x2019;s movie Apocalypse Now, or the film Chariots of Fire, you have experienced works whose titles come right from the Bible. Look at the headlines on this page. Each of them contains an allusion or metaphor that is taken from the Bible. Presidential speeches, Supreme Court decisions, editorials in the newspaper, television programs, even video games and cartoons all contain references to the plots, characters, and teachings of the Bible. The Bible is like a source code for much of life and language in the land where you live. If you are unaware of that source code, your education is incomplete. This course is going to give you an overview of the Bible. But the course is not going to be teaching you about the Bible as a sacred text. You are going to learn about the language, literary forms, plot lines, characters, and contents of the Bible so that you can have a better understanding of literature, art, and culture.</p><h2>Examples &amp; Explanations Legislation, Statutory Interpretation and Election Law</h2><p>A favorite among successful students, and often recommended by professors, the unique <b>Examples &amp; Explanations</b> series gives you extremely clear introductions to concepts followed by realistic examples that mirror those presented in the classroom throughout the semester.

But while the beaux are scrambling for her hand, Kitty counters with her own inventive, if daring, scheme: a sham engagement which should keep wedlock at bay ...<br><br><i>Cotillion</i> shows what made Georgette Heyer the undisputed queen of historical romance - one of the most popular novelists of her day, she is still adored by a huge readership.</p><p>Young Kitty Charing stands to inherit a vast fortune from her irascible great-uncle Matthew--provided she marries one of her cousins. Kitty is not wholly adverse to the plan, if the right nephew proposes. Unfortunately, Kitty has set her heart on Jack Westruther, a confirmed rake, who seems to have no inclination to marry her anytime soon. In an effort to make Jack jealous, and to see a little more of the world than her isolated life on her great-uncle's estate has afforded her, Kitty devises a plan. She convinces yet another of her cousins, the honourable Freddy Standen, to pretend to be engaged to her. Her plan would bring her to London on a visit to Freddy's family and (hopefully) render the elusive Mr Westruther madly jealous. Thus begins <i>Cotillion</i>, arguably the funniest, most charming of Georgette Heyer's many delightful Regency romances.<p>No sooner does Kitty arrive in London than she becomes embroiled in the romantic difficulties of several new acquaintances. Kitty's French cousin, Camille, a professional gambler, has won the heart of her new friend, Olivia--who also happens to be the object of Jack Westruther's dishonourable intentions. Meanwhile, Kitty's doltish cousin Lord Dolphinton has fallen in love with a merchant's daughter who is embattled with his mother and needs his help. Finally, there is Kitty herself, who begins to wonder if the dandified Freddy might not be the man for her after all. As in all of Georgette Heyer's books, <i>Cotillion</i> transcends genre--it is, quite simply, wonderful literature. Historically accurate down to the finest details of dress, deportment and speech, Heyer was also a master at creating unforgettable, comic characters; and Kitty Charing and Freddy Standen stand out as one of her most charming romantic duos ever. --<i>Amazon.com</i></p>"A writer of great wit and style ... I've read her books to ragged shreds" (Kate Fenton <i>Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"Georgette Heyer is unbeatable" (India Knight)<br><br>"Wonderful characters, elegant, witty writing, perfect period detail, and rapturously romantic. Georgette Heyer achieves what the rest of us only aspire to" (Katie Fforde)<br><br>"Charming and comic with plenty of romance" (Kati Nicholl <i>Daily Express</i>)<br><br>"Georgette Heyer deserves the recognition implicit in her inclusion in the Naxos Classic Fiction list, and <i>Cotillion</i> is an excellent first choice. Her funniest book, it is a plucky-innocent-reforms-rake parody, written in her prime in 1953 ... Heyer immersed herself in 18th-century literature" (Christina Hardyment <i>The Times</i>)</p><h2>Rationality in Action (Jean Nicod Lectures)</h2><p><p>The study of rationality and practical reason, or rationality in action, has been central to Western intellectual culture. In this invigorating book, John Searle lays out six claims of what he calls the Classical Model of rationality and shows why they are false. He then presents an alternative theory of the role of rationality in thought and action.</p><p>A central point of Searle's theory is that only irrational actions are directly caused by beliefs and desires&#x2015;for example, the actions of a person in the grip of an obsession or addiction. In most cases of rational action, there is a gap between the motivating desire and the actual decision making. The traditional name for this gap is "freedom of the will." According to Searle, all rational activity presupposes free will. For rationality is possible only where one has a choice among various rational as well as irrational options.</p><p>Unlike many philosophical tracts, <i>Rationality in Action</i> invites the reader to apply the author's ideas to everyday life. Searle shows, for example, that contrary to the traditional philosophical view, weakness of will is very common. He also points out the absurdity of the claim that rational decision making always starts from a consistent set of desires. Rational decision making, he argues, is often about choosing between conflicting reasons for action. In fact, humans are distinguished by their ability to be rationally motivated by desire-independent reasons for action. Extending his theory of rationality to the self, Searle shows how rational deliberation presupposes an irreducible notion of the self. He also reveals the idea of free will to be essentially a thesis of how the brain works.</p></p><p>John R. Searle is Mills Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Language at the University of California, Berkeley.<p><i>Rationality in Action</i> will prove to be a classic on the topic of human agency which will endure for the ages.

I wrote the book during one of the most volatile years in the U.S. markets. Through firsthand interviews and unprecedented access, each chapter profiles one of the biggest and most successful names in the industry, specifically including Ray Dalio, John Paulson, David Tepper, Bill Ackman, Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner, Dan Loeb, Jim Chanos, Boaz Weinstein, Pierre LaGrange and Tim Wong. <br><br> <b>You had unprecedented access to these managers through the course of writing <i>The Alpha Masters</i>. Why do you think you were able to "go behind the curtain"?</b><br> As any good journalist will tell you, when you focus on the facts and developing your story, the rest will follow. My objective in writing <i>The Alpha Masters</i> was to dig deep into the backgrounds and investment philosophies of some of the world's greatest investors in order to really tell their stories for the first time. As a producer at CNBC for over four years, I have slowly built strong relationships and trust with these investors which I have now taken several steps further with the publishing of <i>The Alpha Masters</i>.<br><br> I believe I was able to "go behind the curtain," so to speak, because all of my subjects believed there were extremely valuable lessons to be learned from their extensive experiences and insights. Hopefully readers of the book will agree and be able to put some of the philosophies shared in the book into practice in their own lives and portfolios!<br><br> <b>Why are hedge funds such a mystery?</b><br> There are a few key reasons, but foremost, the general public doesn't have the ability to invest in hedge funds because they are restricted to "accredited investors" under Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This usually means an individual with net worth of at least $1 million or annual income over $200,000.<br><br> Also, hedge funds have only been around for less than a century. While there are a lot of mixed opinions--even among the investors profiled in the book--about what actually constitutes a hedge fund, the investment strategies are complex and believed by many to contain marks of genius. Thus, hedge fund managers have historically shied away from publicly explaining their methods, not only because they are difficult to understand, but from fear of giving away the secret sauce.<br><br> <b>Who should read this book?</b><br> This book is for investors, market participants, business students, and anyone curious about the markets and interested in a "hedge- ucation."<br><br> <b>You interviewed some of the top hedge fund managers in the world. What defining characteristic do you think stands out among them?</b><br> In one word? Drive.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Alpha Masters</i></b> <p>"This is one of the very few books I know of that crawls inside the minds of today's most brilliant investors to get the play-by-play of their best (and sometimes worst) investments. You feel as though you are sitting across from the likes of John Paulson and David Tepper as they share their most sought-after techniques and analysis.

From fairies and friendship to dolphins and mermaids, this is a treasure trove for every child&#39;s bookshelf.K-Gr 3-Using a selection of snippets from Shakespeare's plays, Mayhew depicts a typical day in the life of a bucolic family from a previous century as a mother, her three sweet-faced children, and a young neighbor cavort in the fields, streams, and along the seashore from dawn to dusk. The boy serves conveniently as the "lover" in "a lover and his lass" and one of the pretend swordfighters in a bit of "the seven ages of man" speech. The impressionistic watercolors, in summery blues, greens, cheerful yellows, and muted reds, are a joy to behold. However, the bits of poetry often do not convey the intended meanings and are interpreted literally by the illustrations, rather than metaphorically in the context of the play ("-our little life is rounded with a sleep"). In addition, some of the vocabulary will drift above the heads of the intended audience, making this book most useful for reading by those families already familiar with Shakespeare, who might set the selections in a wider context. While the book is pretty to look at, it is not likely to send anyone off to find the Shakespearean sources.<p></p><p><i>Susan Hepler, Burgundy Farm Country Day School, Alexandria, VA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Caligula: A Biography</h2><p>The infamous emperor Caligula ruled Rome from A.D. 37 to 41 as a tyrant who ultimately became a monster. An exceptionally smart and cruelly witty man, Caligula made his contemporaries worship him as a god. He drank pearls dissolved in vinegar and ate food covered in gold leaf. He forced men and women of high rank to have sex with him, turned part of his palace into a brothel, and committed incest with his sisters. He wanted to make his horse a consul. Torture and executions were the order of the day. Both modern and ancient interpretations have concluded from this alleged evidence that Caligula was insane. But was he? <br><br>This biography tells a different story of the well-known emperor. In a deft account written for a general audience, Aloys Winterling opens a new perspective on the man and his times. Basing Caligula on a thorough new assessment of the ancient sources, he sets the emperor's story into the context of the political system and the changing relations between the senate and the emperor during Caligula's time and finds a new rationality explaining his notorious brutality.</p><p>&#x201c;Caligula enjoys a reputation as one of the most brutal and tyrannical Roman emperors. In this accessible narrative of Caligula&#x2019;s life, Winterling uses his deep knowledge of Roman society and the imperial court to investigate why contemporaries chose to assassinate Caligula&#x2019;s reputation as well as his person. Caligula emerges here as rather less insane, if no less loathsome, than his posthumous reputation made him out to be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2015;Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, author of <i>Rome&#x2019;s Cultural Revolution</i><br><br><b>Aloys Winterling</b> holds a chair for Ancient History at Humboldt-University Berlin.

Fantasy is a modern literary mode and a popular entertainment. Yet the two have always been inextricably intertwined. <em>Stories about Stories</em> examines fantasy as an arena in which different ways of understanding myth compete and new relationships with myth are worked out. The book offers a comprehensive history of the modern fantastic as well as an argument about its nature and importance. Specific chapters cover the origins of fantasy in the Romantic search for localized myths, fantasy versions of the Modernist turn toward the primitive, the post-Tolkienian exploration of world mythologies, post-colonial reactions to the exploitation of indigenous sacred narratives by Western writers, fantasies based in Christian belief alongside fundamentalist attempts to stamp out the form, and the emergence of ever-more sophisticated structures such as metafiction through which to explore mythic constructions of reality.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brian Attebery </strong>is Professor of English at Idaho State University and the editor of <em>Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts</em>. He is also the coeditor, with Ursula K. Le Guin, of <em>The Norton Book of Science Fiction </em>(Norton, 1997) and the author of <em>Decoding Gender in Science Fiction</em> (Routledge, 2002) among other works.<br><br>"I highly recommend Brian Attebery's new book. It's a scholarly work, but it reads with bright clarity as takes us back and forth between fantasy and myth, showing not only the connections, but also how the best of fantasy is a roadmap that can return the reader to its source material."--<em>Fantasy and</em> <em>Science Fiction</em><p></p><br>"Brian Attebery is the most readable, the most knowledgeable, and the least quarrelsome of critics. <em>Stories about Stories</em> adds new vistas of understanding to his unsurpassed survey of imaginative literature." --Ursula K. Le Guin<p></p><br>"Brian Attebery hits the mother lode in this brilliant archaeology of fantasy and myth. The closest thing to a definitive guide for what C.S. Lewis called 'lies breathed through silver,' <em>Stories about Stories</em> enables us to understand the higher truths of narratives that walk a tightrope between sacred and profane, faith and skepticism, poetry and prose." --Maria Tatar, author of <em>Enchanted Hunters</em><p></p><br>"With radiant clarity, Brian Attebery's <em>Stories about Stories</em> examines what happens when we 'imagine our way into the realms of mastery and wonder' by considering the performative and contextualizing nature of narrative. It is a brilliant book by one of the fantastic's most informed, most penetrating, and wisest critics, who understands that the subjectivity of fictive knowledge is the engine behind its energy and fascination." --Peter Straub<p></p><br>"<em>Stories about Stories</em> is the best analysis we yet possess of mythopoesis. Attebery's work mediates powerfully between the creative appropriations of myth in modern fantasy, a story known to many, and the less well-known stories of the scholarly rediscovery of myth, and the tenuous survival of oral narrative and myth in living context." --Tom Shippey, the author of <em>The Road to Middle Earth</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Crucible of Language</h2><p>From the barbed, childish taunt on the school playground, to the eloquent sophistry of a lawyer prising open a legal loophole in a court of law, meaning arises each time we use language to communicate with one another.

In The Crucible of Language, Vyvyan Evans explains what we know, and what we do, when we communicate using language; he shows how linguistic meaning arises, where it comes from, and the way language enables us to convey the meanings that can move us to tears, bore us to death, or make us dizzy with delight.

Yet Euler's formula is so simple it can be explained to a child. <i>Euler's Gem</i> tells the illuminating story of this indispensable mathematical idea.</p><br><p> From ancient Greek geometry to today's cutting-edge research, Euler's Gem celebrates the discovery of Euler's beloved polyhedron formula and its far-reaching impact on topology, the study of shapes. In 1750, Euler observed that any polyhedron composed of <i>V</i> vertices, <i>E</i> edges, and <i>F</i> faces satisfies the equation <i>V</i>-<i>E</i>+<i>F</i>=2. David Richeson tells how the Greeks missed the formula entirely; how Descartes almost discovered it but fell short; how nineteenth-century mathematicians widened the formula's scope in ways that Euler never envisioned by adapting it for use with doughnut shapes, smooth surfaces, and higher dimensional shapes; and how twentieth-century mathematicians discovered that every shape has its own Euler's formula. Using wonderful examples and numerous illustrations, Richeson presents the formula's many elegant and unexpected applications, such as showing why there is always some windless spot on earth, how to measure the acreage of a tree farm by counting trees, and how many crayons are needed to color any map.</p><br><p> Filled with a who's who of brilliant mathematicians who questioned, refined, and contributed to a remarkable theorem's development, <i>Euler's Gem</i> will fascinate every mathematics enthusiast.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Euler's Gem</i> is a thoroughly satisfying meditation on one of mathematics' loveliest formulas. The author begins with Euler's act of seeing what no one previously had, and returns repeatedly to the resulting formula with ever more careful emendations and ever-widening points of view. This highly nuanced narrative sweeps the reader into the cascade of interlocking ideas which undergird modern topology and lend it its power and beauty."<b>--Donal O'Shea, author of <i>The Poincare Conjecture: In Search of the Shape of the Universe</i></b></p><p>"Beginning with Euler's famous polyhedron formula, continuing to modern concepts of 'rubber geometry, ' and advancing all the way to the proof of Poincare's Conjecture, Richeson's well-written and well-illustrated book is a gentle tour de force of topology."<b>--George G. Szpiro, author of <i>Poincare's Prize: The Hundred-Year Quest to Solve One of Math's Greatest Puzzles</i></b></p><p>"A fascinating and accessible excursion through two thousand years of mathematics.

You will forever think differently about the proper role of behavioral health providers in health care delivery.&nbsp; Even better, you will be prepared to do something about it." -- Steven C. Hayes, <i>University of Nevada</i></p><p>"This book embodies primary care behavioral health practice at its best. It is accessible, focused, based on the latest evidence, and capable of fundamentally changing health care delivery for those who encounter it. It is simultaneously revolutionary in its insistence on population approaches over individual approaches, and a handy toolbox of practical instruments for daily practice. It should be on the shelves of every primary care behavioral health professional and of the physicians and administrators who want to utilize their services." &nbsp;-- Alexander Blount, EdD, Professor of Clinical Family Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School; Chair, Collaborative Family Healthcare Association, author of <i>Integrated Primary Care: The Future of Medical and Mental Health Collaboration.</i></p><p>"Finally, a practical, comprehensive guide for how to successfully integrate a behavioral health service within primary health care. This book covers everything a person needs to know, from tips for getting started to avoiding common pitfalls and ensuring success over the long-term.

Corn's long-awaited new book proposes a remarkable revisioning of the history of American modern art between the two world wars. Moving away from issues of style and abstraction, she bases her work on a broad examination of culture and on discourses of national identity. Corn argues that the key questions for interwar modernists in New York and Paris were whether or not it was possible to create an art that was both American and modern, and if it was, what such an art would look like. Both European and American artists debated these questions and made art that responded to them.<br><br>Corn organizes each chapter around a careful reading of a work of art, probing first its peculiar poetry and style and then its connection to its artist and the cultural influences surrounding it. The result is an unfolding of the work's contingent relationships with history, literature, art criticism, music, and popular culture. The works she examines&#x2014;from those made by the Stieglitz circle to those by European Dadaists&#x2014;were part of the quest for "the Great American Thing," a quest that was international in scope and that inspired a decade of vibrant cultural exchange between the art capitals of Europe and New York.<br><br>Passionate and eminently readable, with more than 300 illustrations&#x2014;drawings, paintings, sculptures, advertisements, cartoons, and documentary photographs&#x2014;<i>The Great American Thing</i> indelibly alters the way we think about the first decades of American modernism and the legacy it created.</p><p>"Wanda Corn's work is a triumph, and will be a welcome and provocative addition to the literature of modernism.

The author&#39;s intention is to remove some of the mystery that surrounds the foundations of mathematics. He emphasises the intuitive basis of mathematics; the basic notions are numbers and sets and they are considered both informally and formally. The role of axiom systems is part of the discussion but their limitations are pointed out. Formal set theory has its place in the book but Dr Hamilton recognises that this is a part of mathematics and not the basis on which it rests. Throughout, the abstract ideas are liberally illustrated by examples so this account should be well-suited, both specifically as a course text and, more broadly, as background reading. The reader is presumed to have some mathematical experience but no knowledge of mathematical logic is required.</p><p></p><h2>The Behaviour of the Domestic Cat</h2><p>Describing feline behavior from both a mechanistic and functional approach, this textbook provides an accessible overview of this fascinating subject. The book begins by addressing physiological, developmental and psychological aspects, with chapters on domestication, the development of the senses, learning, communication and feeding behavior. The authors then build on this foundation to discuss social behavior, hunting and predation, cat-human interactions and welfare. Fully updated throughout, this new edition also includes two new chapters on behavioral disorders due to pathologies and from misdirected natural behavior.</p><p>John W. S. Bradshaw is a Visiting Fellow and Director of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Bristol, where he was formerly Reader in Companion Animal Behavior and University Research Theme Leader for Animal Welfare &amp; Behavior. His main research interests are in the behavior and welfare of domestic cats and dogs, and their relationships with people; he has published over 100 research papers and book chapters on these topics. Since 2009 he has focused his attention on the dissemination of animal welfare science to pet owners: his book <i>Dog Sense/In Defence of Dogs</i> was a non-fiction bestseller in both the UK and USA in 2011, and has been translated into nine other languages. He was one of the founders of the International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ), and has been a member of the Council of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour (ASAB) and set up its Accreditation Committee (1999-present). <br> <br> <b>Author Website</b>"Despite a close, long-standing affiliation with humans, the domesticated cat remains an essential predator. The principal key to understanding the cat's behavioral repertoire is recognition of the fact that most of it derives from the cat's ancestral roots as a solitary hunter. The authors discuss behavior in the context of underlying neutral and sensory physiology. They also address developmental aspects of behavior, including socialization and the influence of kitten playfulness on subsequent adult behavior. The book briefly considers select behavioral problems in relation to disease states and to the complex social systems of cats. The latter, while typically appearing in multi-cat households, are often not appreciated by pet owners. This well-written, interesting book provides a great deal of information about the underlying mechanisms of behavior in domestic cats. The updated edition (1st ed., 1992) will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the study of ethology. <b>Summing Up:</b> Highly recommended." (A.

Time--unkind to so many visionaries--is proving Marshall McLuhan only more and more prescient. His theories, popularly summed up in his famous phrase ``The medium is the message,'' seem to describe our computerized age with eerie precision. He was able to recognize, for example, that the computer would rapidly become an extension of the central nervous system, allowing individuals to extend the range of their sense perceptions. While computer- friendly, his opinion of television, often misunderstood and rarely enunciated in its full disdain, verged on the alarmist: ``If you want to save one shred of Hebrao-Greco-Roman-Medieval-Renaissance-Enlightenment-Modern-West ern civilisation, you'd better get an ax and smash all the sets.'' Given where his ideas would take him, it is superficially incongruous that McLuhan began his professional career as an English professor. But language has fueled much late-20th-century philosophy, and as Canadian academic Gordon (McLuhan for Beginners, not reviewed, etc.) meticulously demonstrates, much of McLuhan's work was substantively informed by a concern with grammar (in the classical sense of the study of relationships within language). At a time when many intellectuals chose either communism or Catholicism--usually for reasons more similar than opposite-- McLuhan chose the Church, and Gordon again carefully illuminates the connections to McLuhan's work. His ideas were dense, complex often to the point of convolution, and thoroughly interwoven. Gordon is not only a user-friendly explicator, he also is a dogged intellectual detective, tracking McLuhan's ideas down to their earliest beginnings. In more conventional biographical terms, this account suffers from the happily married, academically regimented dullness of its subject's life, conjoined with Gordon's relative lack of interest in all non-idea-related details. But as an intellectual history, it's first-rate. (8 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In contrast to Phillip Machand's Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and the Messenger (LJ 3/15/89), this authorized life draws heavily on McLuhan's diaries and private papers as well as on interviews with family and friends. Early on, Gordon takes a traditional biographical approach, focusing on McLuhan's childhood, Cambridge years, marriage, and conversion to Catholicism; later he turns to view the man who coined the term global village and became a pop icon with the publication of The Medium Is the Message (LJ 6/1/67) through a detailed analysis of his work. Gordon provides a straightforward and lucid account of McLuhan's life and ideas, at times defending the media guru against detractors. All facts and explanations notwithstanding, McLuhan remains an enigma. For academic and larger public libraries.?William Gargan, Brooklyn Coll.

In our celebrity-saturated era, it's hard to comprehend what a genuine phenomenon these two siblings from Omaha were. At the height of their success in the mid-1920s, the Astaires seemed to define the Jazz Age. They were Gershwin's music in motion, a fascinating pair who wove spellbinding rhythms in song and dance. <br><br>In this book, the first comprehensive study of their theatrical career together, Kathleen Riley traces the Astaires' rise to fame from humble midwestern origins and early days as child performers on small-time vaudeville stages (where Fred, fatefully, first donned top hat and tails) to their 1917 debut on Broadway to star billings on both sides of the Atlantic. They became ambassadors of an art form they helped to revolutionize, adored by audiences, feted by royalty, and courted socially by elites everywhere they went. From the start, Adele was the more natural performer, spontaneous, funny, and self-possessed, while Fred had to hone his trademark timing and elegance through endless hours of rehearsal, a disciplined regimen that Adele loathed. Ultimately, Fred's dancing expertise surpassed his sister's, and their paths diverged: Adele married into British aristocracy, and Fred headed for Hollywood. <br><br><em>The Astaires</em> examines in depth the extraordinary story of this great brother-sister team, with full attention to its historical and theatrical context. It is not merely an account of the first part of Fred's long and illustrious career but one with its own significance. Born at the close of the 1800s, Fred and Adele grew up together with the new century, and when they reached superstardom during the interwar years, they shone as an affirmation of life and hope amid a prevailing crisis of faith and identity.</p><p><br>Born in Australia and educated at Sydney and Oxford Universities, <strong>Kathleen Riley</strong> is a classical scholar and modern theater historian.

This breakdown skillfully isolates for the reader many subtly different challenges that are often mixed together in other discussions. For example, Nielsen addresses the requirements of viewing pages on varying monitor sizes separately from writing concise text for "scanability." Along the way, the author pulls no punches with his opinions, using phrases like "frames: just say no" to immediately make his feelings known. Fortunately, his advise is some of the best you'll find.</p><p> One of the unique aspects of this title is the use of actual statistics to buttress the author's opinions on various techniques and technologies. He includes survey results on sizes of screens, types of queries submitted to search portals, response times by connection type and more. This book is intended as the first of two volumes--focusing on the "what." The author promises a follow-up title that will show the "hows" and, based on this installation, we can't wait. <i>--Stephen W. Plain</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> Cross-platform design, response time considerations, writing for the Web, multimedia implementation, navigation strategies, search boxes, corporate intranet design, accessibility for disabled users, international considerations, and future predictions.</p>It&#39;s true: Reading this book may be the most cost-effective action youll ever take to ensure that your website still matters a month from now and a year from now. Jakob Nielsen is one of the more sought-after speakers and commentators in the world of high-tech because of his message and the eloquence with which he delivers it. The message is simple--at least on the surface--and is accessible to anyone who will listen (and multitudes do each year): Put USABILITY first. Practice SIMPLICITY. The challenges and complexities to the &#39;put usability first&#39; philosophy of design can begin when ideation turns to planning and planning turns to implementation; the challenges perhaps never stop, but Jakob helps you to understand them and to enable yourself to make the continual adjustments necessary to survive and prosper in the &#39;user-first&#39; world of the web. The best thing about this book, along with what you&#39;ll learn about yourself and others who use the web (and how to improve the usefulness of your website immeasurably), is that Designing Web Usability is flat-out one of the best reads you&#39;ll encounter--in technology publishing or elsewhere. Jakob has a gift for communication that enables him to wrap his vision in a lucid, compelling discourse that appeals to academics and lay people, web designers and web users. Designing Web Usability holds this broad appeal because Jakob&#39;s message makes so much sense, while being masterfully communicated on so many levels. Who said you can&#39;t have fun while expanding your horizons? New Riders is honored to have worked with Jakob Nielsen over the past two years as he&#39;s written and refined Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity.

Ljungquist's Introduction to <i>Ethan Frome and Selected Stories</i></b> <p>Wharton tended to measure her literary achievements against those of male writers; in her introduction, she further distinguished her efforts from previous treatments of New England by discounting her role as a mere recorder of the more superficial or external features of her setting. She thus emphasized the steps in the construction of <i>Ethan Frome</i>&#x2014;that is, her role as a conscious literary craftsman. She noted that her initial conception derived from an academic exercise intended to polish her proficiency in the French language. Developed in Paris in 1907, the French sketch of "Ethan Frome" contained three characters (the male was named Hart) and achieved a length that encompassed two scenes, or vignettes, that survived in the published version. The fragment contained a triangular relationship among a husband, his sick wife, and the wife's niece, to whom the "Ethan-character" is attracted; but it lacked the structure that would give focus as well as depth to the narrative. Wharton eventually hit upon the device of a storyteller, but she did not choose one steeped in the lore and history of New England. Rather than a character like the herbalist and healer Mrs. Todd in Jewett's <i>The Country of the Pointed Firs</i> (1896), a native authority on the region's legends and values, Wharton chose someone from outside New England to narrate the story-a looker-on, an observer. </p><p>In her desire for "roundness"&#x2014;Wharton seemed to resort recurrently to the terminology of the "plastic arts" or visual media&#x2014;she would supplement the narrator's perspective with those of her minor characters. The fresh, acute perspective derived from the narrator's growing insight and awareness would compensate for what he lacked in inside background knowledge of the Frome household. While the device of an observer might lend "an air of artificiality" to a tale of sophisticated characters, Wharton noted, this defect might be mitigated if the narrator brought a sophisticated perspective to a tale of simple people. Her narrator would thus serve as a kind of intermediary between the reticent and reserved villagers and Wharton's readers, giving "voice" to characters nearly inarticulate or resigned to silence. </p><p>Wharton's use of an observer eases the reader's entry into Ethan's story. In the opening of the novel the narrator recaptures his first arresting glimpse of Wharton's central character, when he had been struck by Frome's physiognomy and bearing. Harmon Gow, who had driven the stage between Starkfield and other towns in the region's pre-trolley days, provides further background on Frome. From Gow the narrator learns of Ethan's age and of his reluctance to escape Starkfield because of obligations to care for his failing parents. The narrator also hears not only Gow's chilling comment on Ethan's endurance&#x2014;"Ethan'll likely touch a hundred"&#x2014;but also his opinion that Ethan's stay in Starkfield constituted a kind of imprisonment: "Guess he's been in Starkfield too many winters. Most of the smart ones get away". The narrator's interview of Gow develops the tale only "as far as his [Gow's] mental and moral reach permitted", and he hopes that the more educated, sophisticated Mrs. Ned Hale, with whom he is staying, will provide greater insight. He cannot cut through her reserve and reticence, however, even though she has more firsthand knowledge of the aftermath of the accident that scarred Frome's forehead. Implying a suffering too great for words, her only comment is: "It was awful". </p><p>The narrator infers that he must piece together Ethan's story from different sources, and that consequently each retelling will be a little bit different. The meaning of the story, he infers, will be found even in gaps or silences after he has accumulated a succession of hints, suggestions, and clues that surround Frome. For all the narrator's curiosity about the Frome household, this technique gives his telling an elliptical effect, a sense that much has been left unsaid or not fully articulated. When the winter snows prevent the narrator's return to Starkfield after Frome volunteers to drive him to his business appointment, he is granted a night's shelter at the farm. Enveloped by the severe storm, the narrator experiences a "soft universal diffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies of the morning." In the "formless night" his disorientation temporarily intensifies, and "even [Ethan's] sense of direction, and the bay's homing instinct, finally ceased to serve". The narrator's perplexity and bewilderment imply a need to reorient himself, to jolt himself, so to speak, into a perspective that demands clearer sight and more acute insight. It is at this point that Wharton effects the transition back to the period of Ethan's youth. Although some critics have quarreled with the subjective nature of her narrator's perceptions, there seems little doubt that Wharton intended his narrative to be more than one version of events among others. Accordingly, it is a "vision"; in her 1922 introduction she noted: "Only the narrator has scope to see it all, to resolve it back into simplicity, and to put it in its rightful place among his larger categories." </p></p><h2>Menachem Begin: A Life</h2><p><p><b>The first full-scale biography of one of the most important&#x2014;and enigmatic&#x2014;leaders in Israeli history</b><br><br> This riveting biography is the first to provide a satisfactory answer to the question, Who was Menachem&nbsp;Begin?

Although other waterfront cities also have substantial areas that are built on fill, Boston probably has more than any city in North America. In <i>Gaining Ground</i> historian Nancy Seasholes has given us the first complete account of when, why, and how this land was created.The story of landmaking in Boston is presented geographically; each chapter traces landmaking in a different part of the city from its first permanent settlement to the present. Seasholes introduces findings from recent archaeological investigations in Boston, and relates landmaking to the major historical developments that shaped it. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, landmaking in Boston was spurred by the rapid growth that resulted from the burgeoning China trade. The influx of Irish immigrants in the mid-nineteenth century prompted several large projects to create residential land -- not for the Irish, but to keep the taxpaying Yankees from fleeing to the suburbs. Many landmaking projects were undertaken to cover tidal flats that had been polluted by raw sewage discharged directly onto them, removing the "pestilential exhalations" thought to cause illness. Land was also added for port developments, public parks, and transportation facilities, including the largest landmaking project of all, the airport.</p><p>A separate chapter discusses the technology of landmaking in Boston, explaining the basic method used to make land and the changes in its various components over time. The book is copiously illustrated with maps that show the original shoreline in relation to today's streets, details from historical maps that trace the progress of landmaking, and historical drawings and photographs.</p></p><p><p>Nancy S. Seasholes is an independent scholar, a Research Fellow in the Department of Archaeology at Boston University, and periodically teaches at the Harvard University Extension School. <i>Walking Tours of Boston's Made Land</i> is the companion to her earlier book, <i>Gaining Ground</i> (MIT Press, 2003).</p><p>A book of great import...<b> </b> </p> (Martin Zimmerman <i><i>Landscape Architecture</i></i>)<br><br><p> <i>Gaining Ground </i>is a stunning compilation of material that documents over three centuries' worth of [changes].</p> (Richard Longstreth <i>American Studies International</i>)<br><br><p>...Seasholes has provided a document that brings history alive...</p> (<i><i>Civil Engineering</i></i>)<br><br><p>Seasholes's well-documented study provides a unique perspective on Boston's history.</p> (<i><i>CHOICE</i></i>)<br><br><p>This book charts the 'made land' accretions in anecdote-laced prose... </p> (<i><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></i>)<br><br><p>This book will appeal to those with a special interest in Boston or in the process of landmaking.</p> (<b>Harold Henderson</b> <i><i>Planning</i></i>)<br><br><p>We city walkers and history buffs have all picked up a little architectural history. Architecture is fun, but it won't tell you why Boston looks the way it does. You have to know how there came to be land beneath the streets! Here at last is an easy-reading and complete history of Boston's three centuries of landmaking. With Dr. Seasholes you can follow the story neighborhood by neighborhood or view the city as a whole. This is public history at its best.</p> (Sam Bass Warner, Jr., author of <i>Greater Boston</i>)<br><br><p>For nearly 400 years Bostonians have been busy digging, filling and making land. Whether it was simply dumping refuse into open spaces between wharves or laying out complicated plans to fashion new neighborhoods, we have probably made more land than any other city in America. Filling in is what Boston is all about. In a book that can only be described as a tour de force Seasholes takes us on a tour of 'gained ground.' With the precision of an engineer, the perspective of an architect, the sense of a historian and the perseverance of an archaeologist, she is our Baedeker across every inch of new ground. It is simply not possible to understand Boston without knowing this history, and it is impossible to know this history without reading Seasholes. If you can handle the weight of this hefty volume then tuck it under your arm and head out to the streets and use it to discover Boston underfoot.</p> (William M. Fowler, Jr., Director, Massachusetts Historical Societ)<br><br><p> <i>Gaining Ground</i> is now the definitive treatment of Boston's landmaking. Its scope -- from the central waterfront to East Boston and from 1630 to today -- the depth of its research, and its use of historic maps to illustrate each project make it a truly encyclopedic work.</p> (Richard Garver, Deputy Director, Boston Redevelopment Authority)</p><h2>Bundle: Effective Management, Loose-leaf Version, 7th + MindTap Management, 1 term (6 months) Printed Access Card</h2><p>Discover how award-winning educator and author Chuck Williams does management like no one else with the latest edition of EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT.

Instead of a stable series of policies producing steady growth, China's financial sector has boomed and gone bust with regularity in each decade. The latest decade is little different. Chinese banks have become objects of political struggle while they totter under balance sheets bloated by the excessive state-directed lending and bond issuance of 2009. <p> Looking forward, the government's response to the global financial crisis has created a banking system the stability of which can be maintained only behind the walls of a non-convertible currency, a myriad of off-balance sheet arrangements with non-public state entities and the strong support of its best borrowers--the politically potent National Champions--who are the greatest beneficiaries of the financial status quo. </p><p> China's financial system is not a model for the west and, indeed, is not a sustainable arrangement for China itself as it seeks increasingly to assert its influence internationally. This is not a story of impending collapse, but of frustrated reforms that suggests that any full opening and meaningful reform of the financial sector is not, indeed cannot be, on the government's agenda anytime soon. <br><br> <strong>Q&amp;A with Authors Carl E. Walter and Fraser J. T. Howie</strong><br> <b>You have been writing together about the Chinese financial system for over a decade, what are the biggest changes you have seen?</b><br> The obvious one is just the shear size of the markets and the economy. At the time of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 China&#x2019;s foreign reserves were about 150 billion US$. Now they are twenty times bigger. The number of listed companies has more than doubled, the daily trade volumes in Shanghai have increased ten-fold and only a handful of government bonds had been issued. Now there are thousands of different debt products. Everywhere you look the numbers just seem to get bigger and bigger, but that doesn&#x2019;t tell the whole story. All the growth comes without the expected development: Chinese markets remain primitive in spite of their size. <br><br> <b>How do the markets remain primitive? Surely the growth brought development? </b><br> China has done a fantastic job at building the market infrastructure. Trading and settlement systems and all that goes along with what we would call a modern market is there, but in nearly every case, the market has been warped or restricted by the government. Take the bond market, the government sets interest rates and even the rates at which bonds can be issued. No bond investor considers the possibility of default of the issuer because the assumption is that the government will step in to cover the risk. What then does a bond market do if credit risk and interest rate risk have been removed? In the stock market, the state still remains the largest holder of shares and has majority ownership of all the major companies. No one seriously expects the state to ever sell down their holdings, so the market doesn&#x2019;t price companies but shares. The stock market fundamentally should be about pricing capital and companies, but since the state owns the companies, the market isn&#x2019;t the place where company control and ownership are traded. <br><br> <b>Has the entry of foreign investors, banks and brokers made a difference to the markets? </b><br> In a word, no. There have been a broad range of developments and programs to allow foreign capital into the domestic markets, but foreign onshore operations remain very small and tightly controlled. Foreign stock investors have only been allowed to invest less than 20 billion US$ into Chinese domestic stocks over the past decade; the foreign banks&#x2019; share of the banking market has fallen. Only now are we starting to see foreign capital get into the domestic bond market. China bulls point to this as progress and development, but the pace of change is glacial and the returns limited; foreigners hold only 1.77 percent of Chinese financial assets. <br><br> <b>In <i>Red Capitalism</i> you focus on the banking sector. Why was that? </b><br> It is true that the restructuring of state enterprises in order to sell shares and raise capital has transformed China&#x2019;s corporate sector. It is also the most glamorous area of finance. The truth, however, is that equity capital has provided in any given year less than 10 percent of all corporate capital raised. The real source of corporate finance in China was and remains the banks, which are the very heart of the entire system. <br><br> <b>The Western financial system has been shown to be very imperfect, but does the Chinese model offer an alternative? </b><br> China&#x2019;s bankers have said publicly that after the global financial crisis they no longer have a model to follow. The reason its banks emerged safely from the global turmoil is because they were walled off from it behind an inconvertible currency and tiny international credit exposures. In today&#x2019;s world of global trade, banks must be more than simply purveyors of cheap capital to domestic companies. China&#x2019;s banks have yet to reach out to assist its National Champions in their expansion overseas. So it is inaccurate to compare the two financial systems. <br><br> <b>You talk about the fragile foundation of China&#x2019;s rise, how do you think that will play out over the next twenty years? Will China become a superpower like America? </b><br> China&#x2019;s weaknesses are very real and the problems will take a lot of determined effort to solve. Perhaps some of them can&#x2019;t be solved without a break with the past, but we want to downplay the idea that collapse is imminent. The Chinese government is not getting rid of its currency controls any time soon, so they will be able to cushion the impact of any downturn reasonably well. The weakness of the system will play out through continual misallocation of capital and resources. Investment will follow political whim, resulting in tremendous waste and corruption. China will continue to grow and get bigger, so maybe the economy will be bigger than the states, but it will not be able to exert the same influence that the US can and will continue to do--unless the government embraces real reform across a broad spectrum of issues. <br></p><p>"Carl Walter and Fraser Howie debunk a number of common myths about China's financial markets in this excellent new book. Investors stuffing their portfolios with China stocks would be wise to heed their warnings on the fragile foundations of China's banking system.

With the publication of <i>Social Studies at the Center,</i> Tarry Lindquist and Douglas Selwyn change all that. For the first time, students actually "do" social studies. They read, write, act, sing, dance, and draw social studies. They compare, organize, investigate, interview, and analyze facts. Most of all, they come to love social studies because in the process of studying content, they are learning more about themselves. <p> <i>Social Studies at the Center</i> presents a view of teaching and learning that connects what students learn in social studies with how they learn it and what they feel about it. With an emphasis on meaning and understanding over coverage of facts, the authors demonstrate how to customize learning to accommodate students' interests. They support an integrated approach to social studies teaching and place the subject at the center of the entire school curriculum. </p><p> In addition to providing a large repertoire of learning strategies, Lindquist and Selwyn demonstrate how intermediate and middle school teachers can put social studies skills, content, and knowledge at the center of their school day - with benefits that are reaped beyond the social studies period. Two units are provided as models: one on geography and the other on history. An entire chapter is dedicated to responding to both common and uncommon questions about the teaching and learning of social studies. Another details sixty-eight practical integrative strategies that teachers can put to immediate use. Favorite resources and websites are shared, and a brief review of national standards and assessment strategies are included. </p><p> Whether you are a seasoned or novice teacher, new to the profession or new to the grade level, <i>Social Studies at the Center</i> will serve as that veteran educator down the hall who recognizes that the best learning occurs in an integrated, real-world context and that the best vehicles for achieving this are small group work, hands-on projects, kid-centered research, and student-based assessment.</p></p><p><p>Tarry Lindquist was an enthusiastic presenter and master classroom teacher who worked extensively with both students and teachers in grades K-8.

Laughing Boy was his first novel.I<br><br> He was riding the hundred miles from T&#x2019;o Tlakai to Ts� Lani to attend a dance, or rather, for the horse-racing that would come afterwards. The sun was hot and his belly was empty, but life moved in rhythm with his pony loping steadily as an engine down the miles. He was lax in the saddle, leaning back, arm swinging the rope&#x2019;s end in time to the horse&#x2019;s lope. His new red headband was a bright colour among the embers of the sun-struck desert, undulating like a moving graph of the pony&#x2019;s lope, or the music of his song <br><br> Nashdui bik&#x2019;� dinni, eya-a, eyo-o . . . Wildcat&#x2019;s feet hurt, eya-a, eyo-o . . .&#x2019;<br><br> Rope&#x2019;s end, shoulders, song, all moved together, and life flowed in one stream. He threw his head back to sing louder, and listened to the echo from the cliffs on his right. He was thinking about a bracelet he should make, with four smooth bars running together, and a turquoise in the middle if he could get the silver. He wished he could work while riding; everything was so perfect then, like the prayers, hozoji nashad, travelling in beauty. His hands, his feet, his head, his insides all were hozoji, all were very much alive. He whooped and struck up the Magpie Song till the empty desert resounded <br><br> A-a-a-in�, a-a-a-in�, Ya-a-in�-ain�, ko-ya-ain� . . .&#x2019;<br><br> He was lean, slender, tall, and handsome, Laughing Boy, with a new cheap headband and a borrowed silver belt to make ragged clothes look fine. At noon, having no money, he begged coffee from a trader at Chinlee and went on, treasuring his hunger because of the feasting to come. Now he began to meet Navajos of all ages, riding to the dance. The young men bunched together a line of jingling bridles, dark, excited faces, flashing silver, turquoise, velveteen shirts, dirty, ragged overalls, a pair of plaid calico leggins, a pair of turkey-red ones. Some of them were heavy with jewelry; Horse Giver&#x2019;s Son wore over four hundred dollars in silver alone; most of them had more than Laughing Boy. They stopped to look at his bow-guard, which he himself had made. I am a good jeweller,&#x2019; he said, elated; I make silver run like a song.&#x2019; You should make a song about yourself,&#x2019; they told him, and teach the burros to sing it.&#x2019; Have you had any rain up by T&#x2019;o Tlakai?&#x2019; No, it is just like last year. It is the devil. The grass is all dried up and the sheep are dying.&#x2019; They had a cloudburst over by T&#x2019;isya Lani. It washed out the dam.&#x2019; It washed out the missionary&#x2019;s house, they say. His wife ran out in something thin and got wet, they say.&#x2019; Ei-yei!&#x2019; Tall Hunter and his wife drove past in a brand-new buckboard behind two fast-trotting, grey mules. He owned over five hundred head of horses, and his wife had thick strings of turquoise and coral around her neck. His brother is in jail for stealing cattle, they say.&#x2019; What is jail?&#x2019; asked Laughing Boy. Slender Hair explained: It is something the American Chief does to you. He puts you in a room of stone, like a Moqui house, only it is dark and you can&#x2019;t get out. People die there, they say. They haven&#x2019;t any room; they can&#x2019;t see anything, they say. I do not like to talk about it.&#x2019; Laughing Boy thought, I should rather die. He wanted to ask more, but was ashamed to show his ignorance before these southern Navajos, many of whom wore hats like Americans, and who knew so much of Americans&#x2019; ways. They raced. His horse was tired, but it won by a nose, which was just as well, since he had bet his bow-guard. Now he had six dollars. He hoped there would be gambling. Ts� Lani showed a distant bonfire in the dusk, with mounted Indians moving in on it like spokes of a wheel. About two hundred young men came together half a mile away, making their ponies prance, exchanging greetings. Crooked Ear carried the ceremonial wand. Now they all lined up, with the dull, red sunset behind their black figures. They started going like getting off to a race, right into a gallop, yelling. Over by the fire was shouting, and another line tearing towards them. The world was full of a roar of hooves and two walls of noise rushing together, the men leaning forward over their horses&#x2019; necks, mouths wide. E-e-e-e-e!&#x2019; They met in a great swirl of plunging, dodging horses, and swept on all together, whooping for dear life, with the staff in front of them, almost onto the fire, then dissolved with jingling of bits, laughter, and casual jokes as they unsaddled by the pool. The steady motion of excitement was slowed then, in the last of the day, by the rocks and the pinons, by the reflection of the sky in the pool where flat, vague silhouettes of horses stooped to drink. The voices of many people, the twinkling of fires continuued the motif, joining the time of quiet with elation past and to come; a little feeling of expectation in Laughing Boy&#x2019;s chest, a joyful emptiness, part hungeeeeer and part excitement. He tended his pony minutely. The little mare had had two days of loping; shortly he wanted to race her; three days of rest would not be too much. She was his only horse; he had traded two others for her. She was tough, as a horse had to be to live at all in the North country. He ran his hands down her withers, feeling the lean, decisive muscles. In all that section, from Dennihuitso to Biltabito, from T&#x2019;o Tlikahn to T&#x2019;o Baka, where he knew every horse by sight, she was the best, but she would meet some competition here. He felt as if she were his own creation, like the bowguard; at least he had selected her, as he had chosen the soft blue turquoise in the ornament. Little, compact, all black save for the tiny white spot on her forehead, she had the ugly Roman nose of character. She was like an arrow notched to a taut bowstring a movement of the hand would release level flight swiftly to a mark. He was thinking some of these things, half hearing the noises of the people. Just like the prayer, travelling in beauty.&#x2019; It would be good to be a singer as well, to express all these things through the prayers. He would like to know many of them, to learn to conduct the Mountain Chant, and know all the beautiful stories behind the songs and ceremonies inside the Dark Circle of Branches. That would be really on the trail of beauty; to work in silver and turquoise, own soft-moving ponies, and lead the Mountain Chant. Just thinking about it was good. It made him feel cool inside.<br><br> Hozho hogahn ladin nasha woyen . . . In the house of happiness there I wander . . .&#x2019;<br><br> All the time he was passing his hand along the pony&#x2019;s neck, along her back, feeling the lines of tough muscles. E-ya, Grandfather, are you going to dance with the horse?&#x2019; Jesting Squaw&#x2019;s Son called over to him, food is ready.&#x2019; Hakone!&#x2019; He returned abruptly to the quick-moving life of the dance. I can eat it. I did not know you were coming.&#x2019; I came when I heard you were to race your mare. I think there is money to be made, then, and I want to see her race.&#x2019; They went up arm in arm into the crowd, pushing their way into the circle around one of the fires. Busy housewives gave them coffee, the big pot of meat was passed over, and a flat, round loaf of rubbery, filling bread. The meat was the backbone of a yearling calf, boiled with corn. It was good. He munched joyfully, feeling his empty stomach fill, wadding himself with bread, washing it down with bitter coffee. A couple of Americans carrying their own plates dipped in gingerly. A Hopi, having collected everything he could possibly eat, sat down officiously beside them to air his school English and his bourgeois superiority.<br><br> II<br><br>A small drum beating rapidly concentrated the mixed noises into a staccato unison. Young men gathered about the drummer. Laughing Boy might have eaten more, but he left the fire immediately with Jesting Squaw&#x2019;s Son. Some one led off high-pitched at full voice,<br><br> Yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana . . .&#x2019;<br><br> By the end of the second word the crowd was with him; more young men hurried up to join the diapason,<br><br> Galeana ena, galeana eno, yo-o ay-e hena ena . . .&#x2019;<br><br> They put their arms over each other&#x2019;s shoulders, swaying in time to the one drum that ran like a dull, glowing thread through the singing, four hundred young men turning loose everything they had. A bonfire twenty feet long flared to the left of them. Opposite, and to the right, the older people sat wrapped in their blankets., Behind them, men crouched in their saddles, heads and shoulders against the night sky, nodding time to the rhythm, silent, with here and there a reflection of firelight on a bit of silver, a dark face, or a horse&#x2019;s eye. Twelve girls in single file stole into the open space, moving quietly and aloof as though the uproar of singing were petrified into a protective wall before it reached them. Only the pulse of the drum showed in their steps. They prowled back and forth before the line of young men, considering them with predatory judgment. Laughing Boy at the back of the crowd looked at them with mild interest; he liked to watch their suave movements and the rich display of blankets and jewelry. One caught his attention; he thought she had on more silver, coral, turquoise, and white shell than he had ever seen on any one person. He speculated on its value horses she must have a very rich mother, or uncles. She was too slender, seeming frail to dance in all that rich, heavy ornamentation. He wished she would move more into the firelight. She was well dressed to s...</p><h2>Race for the Reichstag: The 1945 Battle for Berlin (Soviet (Russian) Military Experience)</h2><p>The soldiers of the Red Army identified the Reichstag as the victor&#39;s prize to be taken in Berlin.

Most now agree that the protection of consumer welfare should be the only goal of antitrust laws. Execution, however, is another matter. The rules of antitrust remain unfocused, insufficiently precise, and excessively complex. The problem of poorly designed rules is severe, because in the short run rules weigh much more heavily than principles. At bottom, antitrust is a defensible enterprise only if it can make the microeconomy work better, after accounting for the considerable costs of operating the system. </p><p> <i>The Antitrust Enterprise</i> is the first authoritative and compact exposition of antitrust law since Robert Bork's classic <i>The Antitrust Paradox</i> was published more than thirty years ago. It confronts not only the problems of poorly designed, overly complex, and inconsistent antitrust rules but also the current disarray of antitrust's rule of reason, offering a coherent and workable set of solutions. The result is an antitrust policy that is faithful to the consumer welfare principle but that is also more readily manageable by the federal courts and other antitrust tribunals. </p></p><p><b>Herbert Hovenkamp</b> is Ben V. and Dorothy Willie Professor of Law and History, University of Iowa College of Law.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/HOVANT_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>True Identity: The Bible for Women (NIV)</h2><p>The Bible that helps you see yourself as God sees you. No matter what your stage in life, you&#39;re probably facing a challenge or a change. Whatever you&#39;re facing, you probably share your struggles with a friend. Now imagine your friend has incredible wisdom and is available anytime of the day or night! That&#39;s what this Bible is about: becoming who you are in Christ through your relationship with him. * 100 &#39;Myth&#39; articles---States a commonly accepted myth that the world tells you is true, then refutes the myth with the truth of God&#39;s Word. * 30 &#39;Ask Me Anything&#39; notes---Profiles a woman from the Bible in an interview format where the biblical woman speaks to the modern readers about the life issue she faced. * 200 &#39;Conversations&#39; notes---Penetrating questions to reflect on, either alone or with a friend or mentor. * 200 &#39;He Is&#39; callouts---Highlights an attribute of God as shown or taught in Scripture and teaches how that affects a woman&#39;s identity. * 300 &#39;At Issues&#39; notes---Short teaching notes on life topics such as money, sex, or pride. * 66 book introductions * Topical index * Back matter articles on topics such as mentoring, developing a consistent quiet time, Bible reading plans, memorizing Scripture, etc. True Identity is designed to help you live out who you are in Christ in practical ways as a woman living in today&#39;s world. Drawing on the truths of Scripture, the features in this Bible will strengthen you with insights and encouragement for the issues you face. Some of the features include: Myths: I&#39;ll never be free from my past. If I&#39;m good, God will love me. My husband is the only one who needs to change. If I&#39;m a good Christian, then nothing bad will happen to me. My company owes me. You&#39;ve heard them before. How many do you believe? They&#39;re commonly accepted myths of our culture---myths about love, relationships, God, fulfillment, sex, faith, right and wrong, and a lot more. Don&#39;t believe the lies of this world! The 100 &#39;Myths&#39; articles in True Identity expose different myths that many women believe. Each article opens with the first-person story of a woman who believes a particular myth and how that affects her life. A statistic or quote shows how common the myth is in our society or what someone has said about it. Then, most importantly, principles from the Bible refute the myth and offer practical guidance and help. At Issue: The stakes are high when it comes to issues such as marriage, conflict, money, sex, or pride. You need wisdom from God&#39;s Word---and &#39;At Issue&#39; provides it. These 300 succinct notes take you to the heart of important topics, equipping you with biblical insights that can help you face common concerns with uncommon wisdom. Ask Me Anything: If you could sit down with different women of the Bible and ask them about their lives, what would they tell you? In the form of personal interviews, &#39;Ask Me Anything&#39; profiles introduce you to 30 women from the Bible. Offering frank insights drawn from the best and worst of their lives, they have much to say about life today. He Is: Who is God and what is he like? You&#39;ll find out as you read through the &#39;He Is&#39; notes. Highlighting attributes of God, each note gives you a bigger picture of the God who loves you and longs to be in relationship with you.</p><p></p><h2>Child-Loving: The Erotic Child and Victorian Culture</h2><p>The question &#34;What is a child?&#34; is at the heart of the world the Victorians made. Throughout the 19th century, there developed an image of the child as a symbol of purity, innocence and asexuality. Yet at the same time, the child could be a figure of fantasy, obsession, and suppressed desires, as in the case of Lewis Carroll&#39;s Alice or James Barrie&#39;s Peter Pan. This image of the child, as both pure and strangely erotic, is part of the mythology of Victorian culture. Built on a decade of research into literary, medical, cultural, and legal materials, &#34;Child-Loving&#34; traces the growth of Victorian - and modern - concepts of the body, the child, sexuality, and the stories we tell about them. The Victorians, Kincaid argues, viewed children in ways that seem to us now both complex and bizarre. But do we fare better today? While our culture recoils from the horror of child molestation, we offer children&#39;s bodies as spectacles in the media, giving children an erotic attention we wish to deny. &#34;Child-Loving&#34; writes a additional chapter in the history of the Victorian era.</p><p><strong>James R. Kincaid</strong> is Aerol Arnold Professor of English at the University of Southern California.Why are we obsessed by stories of child molesting by strangers or child care workers, despite the evidence that such events are very rare? The author (English, Univ. of Southern California) offers startling views on this and other issues concerning child sexuality. His material spans a number of disciplines, including 19th-century literature and child care books, modern social history, court transcripts, and sex manuals. While the book suffers from a surfeit of deconstuctionist verbiage, the author's wide-ranging scholarship and provocative ideas more than make up for the shortcomings. Recommended for most academic and research libraries and for larger public libraries that collect academic material for educated lay readers.<br><i>- Mary Ann Hughes, Washington State Univ. Libs., Pullman</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A New Psychology Of Men</h2><p>Inspired by feminist scholars who revolutionized our understanding of women's gender roles, the contributors to this pioneering book describe how men's proscribed roles are neither biological nor social givens but rather psychological and social constructions. For the first time in one volume, the leading voices in the study of male psychology authoritatively detail how men's roles are created and how men's attempts to live up to these unhealthy and unrealistic models of masculinity warp men and society.Questioning the traditional norms of the male role (such as the emphasis on aggression, competition, status, and emotional stoicism), they show how some male problems (such as violence, homophobia, devaluation of women, detached fathering, and neglect of health needs) are unfortunate by-products of the current process by which males are socialized. By synthesizing the latest research, clinical experience, and major theoretical perspectives on men and by figuring in cultural, class, and sexual orientation differences, the authors brilliantly illuminate the many variations of male behavior. This book will be a valuable resource not just for students of gender psychology in any discipline but also for clinicians and researchers who need to account for the relationship between men's behavior and the contradictory and inconsistent gender roles imposed on men.This new understanding of men's psychology is sure to enhance the work of clinical professionals&#x2014;including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses&#x2014;in helping men reconstruct a sense of masculinity along healthier and more socially just lines.</p><p><b>William Pollack, Ph.D.</b>, a clinical psychologist, is the codirector of the Center for Men at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School, and a founding member and Fellow of the Society for Psychological Study of Men and Masculinity of the American Psychological Association.

Andrews This volume is one of the first cohesive treatments of the use of mathematics for studying interactions between various recognition environments. It brings together techniques previously scattered throughout the literature and provides a concise common notation that will facilitate the understanding and comparison of the many aspects of mathematical pattern recognition. The contents of this volume are divided into five interrelated subject areas: Feature Selection, Distribution Free Classification, Statistical Classification, Nonsupervised Learning, and Sequential Learning. Appendices describing specific aspects of feature selection and extensive reference and bibliographies are included. 1972 253 pp. Threshold Logic and its Applications by Saburo Muroga This is the first in-depth exposition of threshold logic and its applications using linear programming and integer programming as optimization tools. It presents threshold logic as a unified theory of conventional simple gates, threshold gates and their networks. This unified viewpoint explicitly reveals many important properties that were formerly concealed in the framework of conventional switching theory (based essentially on and, or and not gates). 1971 478 pp. Knowing and Guessing A Quantitative Study of Inference and Information By Satosi Watanabe This volume presents a coherent theoretical view of a field now split into different disciplines: philosophy, information science, cybernetics, psychology, electrical engineering, and physics. The target of investigation is the cognitive process of knowing and guessing. In contrast to traditional philosophy, the approach is quantitative rather than qualitative. The study is formal in the sense that the author is not interested in the contents of knowledge or the physiological mechanism of the process of knowing. "The author&#x2019;s style is lucid, his comments are illuminating. The result is a fascinating book, which will be of interest to scientists in many different fields." &#x2014; Nature 1969 592 pp.</p><p>Provides a unified, comprehensive and up-to-date treatment of both statistical and descriptive methods for pattern recognition. The topics treated include Bayesian decision theory, supervised and unsupervised learning, nonparametric techniques, discriminant analysis, clustering, preprosessing of pictorial data, spatial filtering, shape description techniques, perspective transformations, projective invariants, linguistic procedures, and artificial intelligence techniques for scene analysis.Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis By Richard O. Duda and Peter E. Hart Here is a unified, Comprehensive, and up-to-date treatment of the theoretical principles of pattern recognition. These principles are applicable to a great variety of problems of current interest, such as character recognition, speech recognition, speaker identification, fingerprint recognition, the analysis of biomedical photographs, aerial photoreconnaissance, automatic inspection for industrial quality control, and visual systems for robots. Throughout Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, the authors have balanced their presentation to reflect the relative importance of the many theoretical topics in the field. Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis is the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of both statistical classification theory and computer analysis of pictures. Part I covers Bayesian decision theory, supervised and unsupervised learning, nonparametric techniques, discriminant analysis, and clustering. Part II describes many techniques of current interest in automatic scene analysis, including preprocessing of pictorial data, spatial filtering, shape-description techniques, perspective transformations, projective invariants, linguistic procedures, and artificial intelligence techniques for scene analysis. Although the theories and techniques of pattern recognition are largely mathematical, the authors have been more concerned with providing insight and understanding than with establishing rigorous mathematical foundations. The many illustrative examples, plausibility arguments, and discussions of the behavior of solutions reflect this concern. Extensive bibliographical and historical remarks at the end of each chapter further enhance the presentation. Standard notation is used wherever possible, and a comprehensive index is included. Typical first-year graduate students will find most of the mathematical arguments well within their grasp. Because the exposition is clear and balanced, Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis is suitable for both college and professional use. In particular, it will appeal to graduate students and professionals in the fields of computer science, electrical engineering, and statistics. Students and professionals in psychology, biomedical science, meteorology, and biology will also find it of value for the light it sheds on such areas as visual perception, image processing, and numerical taxonomy.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Physics</h2><p>The guide to accompany the fifth edition of this introduction to physics. This text addresses the issue of building &#34;bridges of reason&#34;, so that students may move from qualitative understanding of any given physics concept to making decisions about how to solve a problem involving that concept.</p><p>For four editions, Fundamentals of Physics has successfully prepared physics students for careers in science and engineering. This newest edition expands on the strengths of earlier versions, helping students bridge the gap between concepts and reasoning. Students are shown, rather than told about, how physics works and are given the opportunity to apply concepts to real-world problems. Each chapter and concept has been scrutinized to ensure clarity, currency, and accuracy while checkpoints, problem solving tactics, and sample problems help students make sense of new concepts. As always, Fundamentals of Physics covers every aspect of basic physics, from force and motion to relativity and will prepare today&#39;s students to be tomorrow&#39;s scientists.&nbsp;</p><h2>Beyond the Moon: A Conversational, Common Sense Guide to Understanding the Tides</h2><p>Finally, someone has written a comprehensive, easily readable explanation of the tides on earth that is both simple enough for students and solid enough for their professors. Step by step, by analogy and illustration, Beyond the Moon describes how the cyclical motion of the near solar system is impressed upon the earth&#39;s oceans, and how the hydraulics over the continental shelf and the geography of the coastline orchestrate this rhythm into the bewildering variety of tide patterns seen around the globe. This volume demystifies the complexity of the tides by systematically examining its many constituents and demonstrates that: &#34;Nature is, at once, awesome in complexity and beautiful in simplicity.&#34;</p><p>?McCully&#39;s dissection of the sciences eases the journey and his prose is very readable, even literary at times ...&#34;</p><h2>Life Photographers: What They Saw (BULFINCH)</h2><p>A collection of interviews and 270 photographs traces the work, experiences, and careers of the original staff photographers of LIFE magazine, documenting how they pioneered the picture story and the photographic essay. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>John Loengard joined Life magazine&#39;s staff in 1961. Hailed by American Photographer as &#34;Life&#39;s most influential photographer&#34; during the 1060s and instrumental in its rebirth as a monthly in 1978, Loengard served as its pictures editor until 1987. His books of his own photographers include PICTURES UNDER DISCUSSION, CLEBRATING THE NEGATIVE, and GEORGIA O&#39;KEEFE at GHOST RANCH. He is also the editor of LIFE CLASSIC PHOTOGRAPHERS: A PERSONAL INTERPRETATION, and LIFE FACES. Loengard lives in New York City.For all the images that constantly bombard us, do we see the world any more clearly than our parents did back when, once a week, LIFE magazine appeared in mailboxes and on newsstands? <p>The author, a former Life photographer and editor, interviewed eighty-eight photographers who worked for the magazine sometime between 1936, when it was founded by Henry R. Luce, and 1972, when it ceased weekly publication. </p><p>Over the years, Life photographers were harassed, arrested, shot at, killed. The hobnobbed with royalty and slept with refugees. And always they completed furiously. (One even took a shot at another Life photographer whom he suspected of poaching on his story.) </p><p>What comes through is their resourcefulness and intelligence. They did not invent photojournalism, which had been practiced in Europe for a decade, but Life photographers raised the status of photojournalists to that of world journalists. Ironically, around the magazine they were considered second-class citizens, clearly the social and intellectual interiors of the mainly Ivy League editors and writers in Luce's empire. They were paid less and, for years, were banished to a separate building where they did not even have their own restroom. </p><p>The images reproduced here suggest that they have had their revenge. Long after Life's published words have been forgotten, these pictures live on: Carl Mydans' image of General Douglas MacArthur wading ashore in the Philippines; Alfred Eisenstaedt's famous shot of the V-J Day kiss in Times Square; Dmitri Kessel's photo, by the light of a single lantern, of a wartime meeting between Churchill and members of the Greek government. (Almost every Life photographer got a shot at Churchill). For almost four decades, what Life's photographers saw, we all saw. </p><p>"Do you think photography is an art?" the author asked photographer George Silk. </p><p>"No," Silk replied. "I think it's fun." -- <i>The American Way, Bill Marvel, November 1998</i><br><br>John Loengard, himself a <i>Life</i> veteran, has done us all a service by interviewing 43 of <i>Life</i>'s best-known photojournalists (and including a CBS interview with himself) about the how, who, what, where and when of their most famous pictures. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Andy Grundberg</i><br><br>Two books have just appeared concerning the evolution of photojournalism form the mid-1930s onward. John Loengard's LIFE PHOTOGRAPHERS : WHAT THEY SAW has a simple premise: What do photographers who worked for Life magazine have to say for themselves? Loengard, himself one of their number, interviewed 44 of them - almost half the total - in the early 1990s, editing results down to 200,000 words that, along with 250 images, pack this volume. Loengard has a handful of stock questions - what was your relationship with Life pictures editor Wilson Hicks? Do you think of yourself as an artist? But he also knows the particulars of his colleague's careers, and gently prods them toward pointed disclosures. Not that they seem to need a lot of persuading in that regard. On the whole, of course, they're middle-aged to elderly people repeating tales as they told them for decades. In the ease of the better-known faces - Alfred Eisenstaedt, Cornell Capa, Gordon Parks - these stories are often familiar. But the book is full of commentary by others less frequently heard from: Myron Davis, John Flores, Nina Leen, George Silk, and many more. So there is much here that new. Cumulatively, it adds up to a multi-faceted vision of the glory days of the picture press as seen from inside the most trend-setting of all those publications, as well as an extended-family history of one particular long-term collusion (and collision) between information ally oriented photographers and corporate media culture. -- <i>Photography In New York, A.D. Coleman, November/December 1998</i><br><br>What didn't they see, those powerful photojournalists who worked for Life magazine in its heyday: wars, summit conferences, urban squalor, country comforts, lives of the rich and the poor, political events, minority struggles, the famous and the infamous, on and on and on. This show celebrates the publication of a book containing interviews with 44 Life photographers by John Loengard, Life's former picture editor. </p><p>Many of the photographers in it are world-renowned like Andreas Feininger, Carl Mydans, Cornell Capa, Gordon Parks, Dmitri Kessel, Alfred Eisenstaedt, all of them made memorable pictures in the days before television cut in on Life's turf. </p><p>Some of the great images are here, and may not be unfamiliar in Life readers who go back far enough, like Hansel Meith's unforgettable close-up of a lone male rhesue monkey half submerged in a body of water, scowling balefully at the intrusive lens. Less well know, but equally startling is David Scherman's 1945 shot of Lee Miller half submerged in Hitler's bathtub in Munich, looking winsome as she prepares to scrub her back. </p><p>General Douglas MacArthur lands on Luzon in the Philippines that same year, sloshing through water under the watchful lens of Mr. Mydans; in 1954 a group of Little Leaguers in Manchester, N.H., recorded by Yale Joel, drop their illfitting pants in a demand for new ones. Bill Kay was on hand at the 1952 Democratic fund raiser in Madison Square Garden where Marilyn Munroe sang "Happy Birthday" to President John Kennedy, and Harry Benson caught a pillow flight among the Beatles at the George V Hotel in Paris 1964. </p><p>This is photography of an in the moment; it has no esthetic aspirations. Still the show reaffirms that photojournalism is an art all its own. -- <i>New York Times, Grace Glueck, November 13, 1998</i></p></p><h2>Spells for a Magical Year: 100 Rituals and Enchantments for Prosperity, Power, and Fortune</h2><p><p><b>The ideal reference for any modern witch,&nbsp;<i>Spells&nbsp;for a Magical Year</i> gives a month-by-month guide to spells, rituals, and enchantments. </b>&nbsp;<br> Using planetary, solar, and other natural influences, as well as the ancient power of pagan holidays, goddess energy, and traditional festive dates&#x2014;<b>draw upon beneficial universal energy at any time in the year</b> to maximize your spell success.</p><p>This comprehensive almanac by the best-selling author Sarah Bartlett <b>includes all the important celebrations</b>.

Designed for researchers and mental health professionals ranging from trainee to licensed practitioner, the book is also appropriate for a diverse array of rehabilitation settings, from inpatient to community-based treatment. Full coverage is provided on 12-step programs, as well, including the latest outcomes research. Much of the material is new to this edition: * A chapter has been added on science in the treatment of substance abuse, in which the authors discuss the history of scientific intervention in substance abuse and explore what happens to the brain when addicting drugs are consumed, review animal models and imaging techniques, and discuss current progress in the science of addiction.* Chapters have been added on screening and brief intervention, reflecting the development of brief screening tools and research on the efficacy of interventions, and the role of &#34;recovery&#34; in chronic care disease management -- specifically what the treatment models for alcohol dependence and for diabetes can effectively borrow from each other. * A new chapter focuses on the treatment of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal -- the first steps in treatment of alcohol use disorder.* Two chapters on marijuana -- one on the neurobiology and one addressing treatment have been added. Given the accelerating trend toward decriminalization and legalization of this substance, clinicians will find this information of increasing importance.* The section on substance use issues among gay men and lesbians has been expanded to include bisexual and transgender people in recognition of increased diversity among the population. Well-structured, with topics that follow logically and many practical, treatment-oriented features, such as quick reference tables and lists of recommended readings, The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment is a classic that will enhance the education and practice of clinicians.</p><p><p>The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment is the most authoritative reference for clinicians and researchers in the field of addiction and an excellent manual for residents in psychiatry, general medicine, and allied fields. This thoroughly revised fifth edition retains the basic structure of the last while incorporating new material on a wide variety of topics and integrating the new DSM-5 classification throughout. An impressive roster of contributors present the most current scientific and clinical information on a wide range of substance use disorders, from legal substances such as tobacco and alcohol, to prescription drugs such as OxyContin, to the epidemic of illicit drugs such as methamphetamine and "club drugs," to substances, such as marijuana, that may become a more critical problem as access is liberalized.</p><p>Indispensable for those who treat substance use disorders in doctor's offices, examining rooms, emergency departments, hospitals, and recovery facilities, The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment is comprehensive, compatible with DSM-5, and utterly current. </p>Marc Galanter, M.D., is Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at NYU School of Medicine in New York, New York.

It includes an exhaustive analysis of Gershom Scholem&#39;s views on the subject, an analytical survey of other secondary literature, and a focused examination of primary sources. The work explores a wide range of topics including myth, exegesis, ascent traditions, and cosmology. Although the main focus is on western Gnostic traditions and Merkabah mysticism, the book also includes relevant material from Mandaeism and from later stages of Jewish mysticism such as German Pietism and Kabbalah. Not only is this volume the first to survey and evaluate the history of scholarship on this complex subject, but it also creates new pathways for future studies by illuminating the crucial methodological and topical issues in the field.</p><p></p><h2>Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s</h2><p>Ignorant. Brutal. Male. One of these stereotypes of the Ku Klux Klan offer a misleading picture. In <i>Women of the Klan</i>, sociologist Kathleen Blee unveils an accurate portrait of a racist movement that appealed to ordinary people throughout the country. In so doing, she dismantles the popular notion that politically involved women are always inspired by pacifism, equality, and justice.<br><br>"All the better people," a former Klanswoman assures us, were in the Klan. During the 1920s, perhaps half a million white native-born Protestant women joined the Women's Ku Klux Klan (WKKK). Like their male counterparts, Klanswomen held reactionary views on race, nationality, and religion. But their perspectives on gender roles were often progressive. The Klan publicly asserted that a women's order could safeguard women's suffrage and expand their other legal rights. Privately the WKKK was working to preserve white Protestant supremacy.<br><br>Blee draws from extensive archival research and interviews with former Klan members and victims to underscore the complexity of extremist right-wing political movements. Issues of women's rights, she argues, do not fit comfortably into the standard dichotomies of "progressive" and "reactionary." These need to be replaced by a more complete understanding of how gender politics are related to the politics of race, religion, and class.</p><p><b>Kathleen M. Blee</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh."A meticulous job of historical sleuthing. . . . This down-home side of the K.K.K. in the 1920s resembles not so much the terrorist Klan of today as the myriad white supremacist groups that rally behind the 'new' David Duke." -- <i>Claudia Koonz, New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Thanks to Kathleen M. Blee's superb scholarship in Women of the Klan I must now live with the fact that the Klan contained 'all the better people': businessmen, physicians, judges, social workers (even Quakers, political reformers and (this is the truly discomforting part) feminists. . . . Women of the Klan stands before us as carefully garnered, irrefutable evidence that women are capable of asserting their gender rights in the most noisome settings." -- <i>Barbara Ehrenreich, Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"The author's interviews with women who were dedicated members of the Klan in the 1920s are original and remarkable. . . .The hypocrisy revealed in Women of the Klan could easily translate as the stuff of fiction." -- <i>Herbert Mitgang, New York Times</i><br><br>"[A] superb new book on women in the 1920s Ku Klux Klan . . . . Blee's insight is crucial if we are to uncover, and grasp, the depth of white supremacy." -- <i>Dana Frank, The Nation</i></p><h2>Manager&#39;s Guide to Effective Coaching, Second Edition (Briefcase Books (Paperback))</h2><p><p><b>Boost productivity by making the switch from &#x201c;boss&#x201d; to COACH!</b></p> <p>Effective managers know their job is to help employees succeed, not to give them orders.

A twenty-something New Yorker transplanted to a small Virginia community who boldly befriends the town pariah. A New England widow in search of alcohol and excitement while babysitting her grandson. A Maryland socialite who has built a secret bomb shelter that becomes the center of her imaginative life.&nbsp;<br><br> These are some of the characters who inhabit Nancy Hale&#x2019;s lush fiction. Haunting, vivid, and wonderfully subversive, Hale&#x2019;s stories typically concern women recognizable to all of us&#x2014;sometimes fragile, possibly wicked, deceptively ordinary, navigating their way uncertainly through life.&nbsp;<br><br> Nancy Hale was one of the most accomplished short story artists of her era, winner of ten O. Henry Awards and a frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker </i>from the 1930s to the 1960s. But by the time of her death in 1988, this remarkable writer, so far ahead of her time in her depiction of complex women, was largely forgotten. Now Lauren Groff reintroduces this modern master with a selection of twenty-five of her best stories&#x2014; brilliant short fiction that encompasses childhood and adolescence, marriage and motherhood, desire and infidelity, madness and memory.&nbsp;<br><br> <i>Where the Light Falls </i>reveals Hale as a gifted stylist&#x2014;a painter in light and shadow&#x2014;and an acute observer of modern American life.</p><p><b>NANCY HALE </b>(1908&#x2013;1988), born in Boston to a family whose forebearers include Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale and Harriet Beecher Stowe, was the author of eight novels, including the best-selling <i>The Prodigal Women</i>, four short story collections, two memoirs, two plays, children&#x2019;s stories, and a biography of Mary Cassatt.

Her name would be soaked into the American book consciousness as thoroughly as those of her contemporaries F. Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe. . . . .

Believing that the subjugation of women was primarily political and psychological in origin, Mill urged the establishment of "complete equality in all legal, political, social, and domestic relations between men and women."<br>Arguing for both legal reforms and a social revolution, he focuses on women's exclusion from the political process, their lack of any rights in marriage, and the benefits to be obtained by their liberation. Moreover, if they are to share the freedoms enjoyed by men, equal opportunities for employment and education for women are also necessary.<br>For its time, the work was radical and far-reaching in its demands; but despite its repeated emphasis on forms of oppression and recognition of the difficulties endured by women, it is essentially an optimistic work maintaining a firm belief that increased equality and liberty for women were inevitable.<br>Carefully researched and clearly expressed with great logic and consistency, the book remains a landmark in the struggle for human rights. In this inexpensive edition, it will certainly be welcomed by feminists but will also appeal to anyone interested in the philosophical, human, and social issues underlying the idea of freedom and equality for all people, regardless of gender.</p><p>Written in 1861 and published eight years later, this influential essay by the great English philosopher and economist is still relevant and its arguments significant.

It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction.Charlotte Bronte's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine--one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved.

The public has been convinced that growth is the natural solution to virtually all social problems&#x2015;poverty, debt, unemployment, and even the environmental degradation caused by the determined pursuit of growth. Meanwhile, warnings by scientists that we live on a finite planet that cannot sustain infinite economic expansion are ignored or even scorned. In <i>Collision Course,</i> Kerryn Higgs examines how society's commitment to growth has marginalized scientific findings on the limits of growth, casting them as bogus predictions of imminent doom.</p><p>Higgs tells how in 1972, <i>The Limits to Growth</i>&#x2015;written by MIT researchers Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, Jorgen Randers, and William Behrens III&#x2015;found that unimpeded economic growth was likely to collide with the realities of a finite planet within a century. Although the book's arguments received positive responses initially, before long the dominant narrative of growth as panacea took over. Higgs explores the resistance to ideas about limits, tracing the propagandizing of &#x201c;free enterprise,&#x201d; the elevation of growth as the central objective of policy makers, the celebration of &#x201c;the magic of the market,&#x201d; and the ever-widening influence of corporate-funded think tanks&#x2015;a parallel academic universe dedicated to the dissemination of neoliberal principles and to the denial of health and environmental dangers from the effects of tobacco to global warming. More than forty years after <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, the idea that growth is essential continues to hold sway, despite the mounting evidence of its costs&#x2015;climate destabilization, pollution, intensification of gross global inequalities, and depletion of the resources on which the modern economic edifice depends.</p></p><p>Kerryn Higgs is an Australian writer. She received her PhD in Geography and Environmental Studies from the University of Tasmania, where she is now a University Associate. She is a Fellow of the International Centre of the Club of Rome.<p>If modern society ever had a core taboo it is against speaking favorably of limits, especially with respect to growth. To accept limits, to question growth is to upset a myth that has sustained the industrial world for a century and more. But that 'sustaining' has been through fossil fuels and problem displacement, not living within ecological means. That time is over, and so should be the taboo. Higgs thus performs a valuable service with her thorough and carefully crafted history of the ideas of limits and growth. It is well worth reading even for those who feel they know the arguments.</p>&#x2015;<b>Thomas Princen</b>, author of <i>The Logic of Sufficiency</i> and <i>Treading Softly</i><br><br><p>Important, wonderful, and shocking. The conspiracy theory that we all thought too fanciful to be true was not so crazy after all, and here is the evidence to prove it.

With Latinos recently surpassing African Americans as the largest minority group in the US, attention has been focused on the important implications of immigration for the character and role of race in US life, including patterns of racial inequality and racial identity.&nbsp;<br> <br> This insightful new book offers a fresh perspective on immigration and its part in shaping the racial landscape of the US today. Moving away from one-dimensional views of this relationship, it emphasizes the dynamic and mutually formative interactions of race and immigration. Drawing on a wide range of studies, it explores key aspects of the immigrant experience, such as the history of immigration laws, the formation of immigrant occupational niches, and developments of immigrant identity and community. Specific topics covered include: the perceived crisis of unauthorized immigration; the growth of an immigrant rights movement; the role of immigrant labor in the elder care industry; the racial strategies of professional immigrants; and the formation of pan-ethnic Latino identities.&nbsp;<br> <br> Written in an engaging and accessible style, this book will be invaluable for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate-level courses in the sociology of immigration, race and ethnicity.</p><p><p><b>NAZLI KIBRIA</b> is Professor of Sociology at Boston University.</p> <p><b>CARA BOWMAN</b> is a doctoral student at Boston University.</p> <p><b>MEGAN O&#x2019;LEARY</b> is a doctoral student at Boston University.</p>"<i>Race and Immigration</i> tackles two of the most important issues facing American society and demonstrates how we cannot understand one without the other.

Odours form the building blocks of cosmologies, class hierarchies, and political odours. They can enforce social structures or transgress them, unite people or divide them, empower or disempower. The authors argue that the sociology of smell is repressed in the modern West, and its social history ignored. This book breaks the &#34;olfactory silence&#34; of modernity. It offers the first comprehensive exploration of the cultural role of odours in Western history - from antiquity to the present. It also covers a wide variey of non-Western societies. Its topics range from the medieval concept of the &#34;odour of sanctity&#34;, to the aromatherapies of South America, and from olfactory stereotypes of gender and ethnicity in the modern West to the role of smell in postmodernity. Its subject matter will fascinate anyone who likes to nose around in the inner workings of culture.</p><p>Aroma uncovers the secret history of smells: from the perfumed banquets of ancient Greece to &#39;the best blueberry flavour ever made&#39;, from the sweet &#39;odour of sanctity&#39; to the latest in designer fragrances.<b>Constance Classen</b> is Reader, Centre for the Study of Religion, University of Toronto. <b>David Howes</b> is Associate Professor of Anthropology, Concordia University, Montreal. <b>Anthony Synnott</b> is Associate Professor of Sociology, Concordia University, Montreal.</p><h2>The Ethics of Deconstruction: Derrida and Levinas</h2><p>In opposition to the polemics claiming that the work of Jacques Derrida is a species of nihilistic textual free play that suspends all questions of value and is therefore immoral and politically pernicious, this book argues that Derridian deconstruction can and indeed should be understood as an ethical demand, provided that ethics is understood in the particular and radical sense given to it in the work of Emmanuel Levinas. Levinas&#39; work, whose full philosophical importance is only now beginning to be recognized, is introduced in this book. Levinas has exerted a powerful and continuous influence on the development of Derrida&#39;s thinking, and by following the textual dialogue between Levinas and Derrida, one can see how the question of ethics can be compellingly raised within deconstruction. This book reinterprets some of the central motifs of Derrida&#39;s work (the closure of metaphysics, difference, the general text) in the light of Levinas&#39; ethical problematic and shows how the very textual practice of deconstructive reading has overriding ethical implications. The book concludes by moving from ethics to politics and assessing whether Derrida&#39;s work offers a persuasive account of the passage from ethical responsibility to political questioning and critique. The book also contains discussions of Heidegger, Husserl, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy.</p><p>Simon Critchley is professor of philosophy at the University of Essex and Directeur de Programme at the College International de Philosophie, Paris.The Ethics of Deconstruction has very many unusual merits.

In its place emerged an international order based on the Western notion of the equal sovereignty of all nations. Prof. Kim&#39;s study, a synthesis of diplomatic and institutional history, examines the process by which China, Japan, and Korea gradually altered their traditional conduct of relations with one another in response to the intrusion of the Western powers in East Asia. He considers the relationship between domestic politics and foreign policy in each of the countries as well as the interaction of their policies as it affected their dealings with one another and with the Western powers. In doing so he demonstrates how the distinctive cultural, political, and social characteristics in China, Japan, and Korea produced different policies designed to safeguard the interest and fulfill the aspirations of each country. His account is revisionist and that it throws in question numerous interpretations of the historical record that have enjoyed general acceptance. A striking example of multi-archival research in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean sources, the volume points the way for future studies of the reactions of the political and cultural entities of East Asia to the common challenge posed by the necessity to modernize their conduct of international relations.</p><p></p><h2>Time Series Analysis: Forecasting &amp; Control (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p><b></b> This is a complete revision of a classic, seminal, and authoritative book that has been the model for most books on the topic written since 1970.

Thapar has incorporated the vast changes in scholarly understanding and interpretation of Indian history that have occurred during her lifetime to revise the book for a new generation of readers. This new work brings to life thousands of years of history, tracing India's evolution before contact with modern Europe was established: its prehistoric beginnings; the great cities of the Indus civilization; the emergence of mighty dynasties such as the Mauryas, Guptas, and Cholas; the teachings of the Buddha; the creation of heroic epics such as the <i>Mahabharata </i>and the <i>Ramayana; </i>and the creation of regional cultures. Thapar introduces figures from the remarkable visionary ruler Ashoka to other less exemplary figures.

In the early chapters the theory behind VPNs is discussed, including needs and uses. Common network and host configurations are also covered. Subsequent chapters drill down into the implementation and configuration of specific software packages. Specific, detailed instructions are included as well as troubleshooting information. This book will be an indispensable resource for anyone who wants to implement a Linux-based VPN. This book will meet the needs of anyone, from the Linux user to the experienced administrator to the security professional. </p> <p> --<i>Oleg Kolesnikov</i> </p></p><p>A virtual private network (VPN) enables computers to access remote resources--like the mail store on another office's mail server--from a geographically remote location. Rather than access the files over a private (and expensive) wide area network (WAN) link, however, a VPN makes its data transmissions across the open Internet. The magic is in making the communications secure, a critical job that requires a tunneling protocol that implements encryption. <i>Building Linux Virtual Private Networks</i> shows you how to set up VPNs without spending a lot of money, and without compromising ease of use or security. Oleg Kolesnikov and Brian Hatch emphasize network-to-network connectivity--fixed links between sites--rather than network-to-client connections. They show you how to use Linux to build a secure system of permanent--yet virtual--data links. There's coverage, for example, of the PoPToP daemon for handling Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), but there's no coverage of non-Linux clients with which to connect it.<p>There's a nice balance of managerial information (useful for justifying a VPN, and a Linux one in particular, to your boss) and technical details in these pages. Each of the covered packages gets nice documentation, complete with listings of configuration files and explicit statements of console input and output. <i>--David Wall</i> </p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> Packages designed to enable VPNs between Linux gateways.

Meninger, O.C.S.O., is a monk of St. Benedict&#39;s Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado.Writing at the intersection of popular psychology and spiritual advice, Meninger describes forgiveness as a process that develops through five stages from "claiming the hurt" to wholeness. Forgiveness is not a matter of forgetting so much as it is a matter of letting go. He illustrates the process with reference to the popular "enneagram" model of personality types, then describes meditational tools for forgiveness grounded in monastic "centering" traditions and Eugene Gendlin's "focusing" technique. This is not a scholarly introduction to any of the traditions mentioned, but it will appeal to readers seeking a popular introduction to techniques for dealing with hurt. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>The Humanistic Tradition Book 3: The European Renaissance, The Reformation, and Global Encounter</h2><p>Interdisciplinary in approach and topical in focus, the sixth edition of <i>The Humanistic Tradition</i> continues to bring to life humankind's creative legacy.

Ranging from Berry&#x2019;s modest beginnings in 1902 as a trade school for rural Appalachian youth to its present-day standing among the Southeast&#x2019;s best liberal arts colleges, the book tells how Martha Berry&#x2019;s founding vision&#x2015;to educate the head, the heart, and the hands&#x2015;evolved to meet the challenges of each new generation. The photographs, many of them rarely seen before, capture happenings at Berry over its first century: preparations for the world wars, visits by renowned benefactors, student protests, expansions of campus facilities, and diverse aspects of daily life in and out of the classroom.</p><p>Parts of Berry&#x2019;s history have achieved legendary status&#x2015;the story, for example, of how Martha Berry was inspired to start a school after visiting with poor mountain children in her log cabin.

This stream-of-consciousness narrative follows his dramatic psychological rationalizations as he struggles to make sense of his experience through the fog of war. Powerful imagery brings the battlefield to life and highlights the disconnect between the generals&#x2019; orders and the deadly chaos on the ground. Stephen Crane&#x2019;s vividly descriptive narrative brings the reader deep into the intensity of the battlefield and explores the psychological effects of warfare on a youthful soldier. One of the most influential war novels ever written, this unabridged original version of <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> was an instant best-seller when it was published in 1895. <br><br><b>Stephen Crane</b> wrote this novel with no first-hand familiarity with war, but it was praised by Civil War veterans as an authentic depiction of their battlefield experiences and emotions.

British Jews have been central to the unfolding of key political events of the modern period, especially the establishment of the State of Israel, but inconspicuous in shaping the character and outlook of modern Jewry. Their story, less dramatic perhaps than that of other Jewish communities, is no less deserving of this comprehensive and finely balanced analytical account.<br><br>Even though Jews were never completely absent from Britain after the expulsion of 1290, it was not until the mid- seventeenth century that a permanent community took root. Endelman devotes chapters to the resettlement; to the integration and acculturation that took place, more intensively than in other European states, during the eighteenth century; to the remarkable economic transformation of Anglo-Jewry between 1800 and 1870; to the tide of immigration from Eastern Europe between 1870 and 1914 and the emergence of unprecedented hostility to Jews; to the effects of World War I and the turbulent events up to and including the Holocaust; and to the contradictory currents propelling Jewish life in Britain from 1948 to the end of the twentieth century. We discover not only the many ways in which the Anglo-Jewish experience was unique but also what it had in common with those of other Western Jewish communities.</p><p>"Elegantly crafted, studded with carefully balanced and shrewd judgments, and brimming with original and intelligent observations."&#x2015;David B.

Conventional wisdom has gathered, like iron filings, at two intellectual poles: at one extreme is a hodge-podge of idiosyncratic, period-specific causes and at the other is a host of all-encompassing "single bullet" theories. In The Panic of 1907, authors Robert Bruner and Sean Carr offer an alternate perspective through a detailed narrative of one of the worst crises in modern financial history--one which ultimately transformed the American financial system and resulted in the establishment of the modern Federal Reserve. <p>Drawing from rare source materials, Bruner and Carr take you day by day through the crisis in 1907, revealing what happened, why it matters, and what we can learn from it. Beginning with a catastrophic earthquake in San Francisco and culminating in the shocking suicide of the deposed president of one of New York's leading financial institutions, this book will draw you into the central issues surrounding the panic of 1907. Throughout this journey, you'll not only become familiar with the events of the crisis, but you'll also discover how larger-than-life figures, such as the inestimable J. Pierpont Morgan, took it upon themselves to provide leadership--and inspire confidence--at a time of great uncertainty and instability. </p><p>Filled with in-depth insights, The Panic of 1907 offers a deeper understanding of what influences financial markets--both then and now. Through this engaging case study of the panic and crash, Bruner and Carr provide a useful framework for understanding these events, suggesting that major financial crises can be the result of a convergence of certain, unique forces--the forces of the market's"perfect storm"--that can cause investors to react with alarm. </p><p>When the many elements of the next financial storm converge, will you be ready? With The Panic of 1907 as your guide, you'll be prepared to assess, understand, and anticipate the factors that can lead to a crisis.</p></p><h2>Great Expectations With Related Readings (Glencoe Literature)</h2><p>Like new.

Written by a veteran editor with experience in both the university press and commercial worlds, the book fields the big questions in a scholar's life. Why do editors choose some books and decline others? How does a writer decide where to submit a project? How does the review process work, and why is it necessary? What can an author expect from a publishing house&#x2014;before, during, and after publication? William Germano answers these questions and more, and along the way, offers encouragement, tips, and warnings.<br><br>This savvy guide unravels the mysteries of publishing and walks you through the process from start to finish. You'll learn how to think about your book before you submit it and what you need to know about your contract. With wit and humor, Germano also addresses some of the finer points of publishing etiquette, including how&#x2014;and how not&#x2014;to approach a busy editor and how to work with other publishing professionals on matters of design, marketing, and publicity. Graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, and experienced authors alike will appreciate the chapters on "Quotations, Pictures, and Other Headaches" and on compiling and editing collections and anthologies.<br><br>"Scholarly publishing is a big, noisy, conversation about the ideas that shape our world," Germano writes, "Here's how to make your book part of that conversation."</p><p><b>William Germano</b> is dean of the faculty of humanities and social sciences and professor of English literature at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Previously, he served as editor in chief at Columbia University Press and vice president and publishing director at Routledge.A former editorial director at Columbia University Press, now publishing director at Routledge, Germano has made a short, sharp, and probably indispensable book for anyone who is hoping to publish a serious nonfiction work. He deconstructs and demystifies what publishers and editors actually do and what authors should look for in finding the right house for their subject and in putting the right words in their contract. He also does a lot of hand-holding through the review process and the production of the manuscript. He is very kind but allows his impish sense of humor free reign, particularly in the glosses that appear in the margins (in a different font). He includes a brief but useful bibliography and, even better, lists "five books to keep at your elbow while you write"--worth the price of admission right there for almost any writer of anything. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Auden's first ten years in the United States were marked by rapid and extensive change in his life and thought. He became an American citizen, fell in love with Chester Kallman, and began to reflect on American culture and to explore the ideas of Reinhold Niebuhr and other Protestant theologians. This volume contains every piece of prose that Auden wrote during these years, including essays and reviews he published under pseudonyms. Most have never been reprinted in any form since their initial publication in such magazines and newspapers as the <i>Nation</i>, the <i>New Republic</i>, <i>Common Sense</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i>.</p><br><p> Auden's prose during this period is frequently directly autobiographical even as he comments on literature, psychology, politics, and religion. The writings range from a dialogue about W. B. Yeats through a respectful parody of Gertrude Stein to Jamesian essays on Henry James. They also include lively and often profound responses to ancient and modern history as well as to contemporary issues in politics and religion. Other highlights include writings on opera and poetry as well as reports of Auden's lectures and the text of an unfinished autobiographical book, <i>The Prolific and the Devourer</i>. Throughout, Edward Mendelson's extensive and illuminating editor's notes explain all contemporary and private allusions.</p><br><p> By making available a large cache of important but previously difficult-to-obtain writings on key subjects, this volume will be of obvious appeal to Auden's legions of admirers.

(<i>Publisher's Weekly</i>)<br><br>"The collection, which can be dipped into as well as read as a whole, is a feast of language and insight, and a brilliant, if indirect, cultural history of the World War II period as well as an often prophetic look at our own."<b>---Arthur Kirsch, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br>"At last, we have a big book in which we can step into the quarry of ideas, good and bad, from which [Auden] mined [his] poems. . . . The essays are overwhelming in the number and variety of the subjects addressed, ideas aired, capital letters employed, and systems invented to prove a small point. . . . The essays are also a reminder of how many more places a poet could work out his worries in public fifty years ago. . . . If he sometimes sounds in the forties as if he were speaking to us from a very high soapbox in a very big square, well, listen: we can hear him, still."<b>---Adam Gopnik, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br>"For anyone interested in 'early Auden' this book is indispensable."<b>---Bernard Knox, <i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>"To read a mere decade's worth of Auden's essays, reviews, articles and miscellaneous musings is to be reminded that the best English poet of the 20th century was one of its brightest commentators. His range of interests was incomparably wide, his manner generally clear and always insightful, his curiosity unflagging."<b>---Glyn Maxwell, <i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>"To have found and contextualized the material collected in this second volume of Auden's prose is a magnificent achievement, and Edward Mendelson's immaculately handled edition will be a scholarly resource of a permanent kind."<b>---Peter MacDonald, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>"Auden's range of topics is impressively, even dizzyingly broad. . . . Auden did not sacrifice depth; numerous pieces are reflective, analytic, and otherwise carefully developed, and few of the pieces seem dated. . . .

The 2018 volume of Annual Perspectives in Mathematics Education (APME) series showcases the efforts of classroom teachers, school counselors and administrators, teacher educators, and education researchers to ensure mathematics teaching and learning is a humane, positive, and powerful experience for students who are Black, Indigenous, and/or Latinx. The book s chapters are grouped into three sections: Attending to Students Identities through Learning Professional Development That Embraces Community Principles for Teaching and Teacher Identity To turn our schools into places where children who are Indigenous, Black, and Latinx can thrive, we need to rehumanize our teaching practices. The chapters in this volume describe a variety of initiatives that work to place these often marginalized students and their identities, backgrounds, challenges, and aspirations at the center of mathematics teaching and learning. We meet teachers who listen to and learn from their students as they work together to reverse those dehumanizing practices found in traditional mathematics education. With these examples as inspiration, this volume opens a conversation on what mathematics educators can do to enable Latinx, Black, and Indigenous students to build on their strengths and fulfill their promise. ABOUT Annual Perspectives in Mathematics Education (APME) NCTM s flagship series is designed to provide a range of perspectives focused each year on a timely topic in mathematics education. APME takes on important subjects and issues, thoughtfully considered by a wide range of authors (including classroom teachers, university researchers, and occasionally educators outside of mathematics education), targeting a diverse audience that reflects NCTM s membership, and featuring chapters that span the pre-K 16 spectrum.</p><p></p><h2>Mathematics into Type</h2><p>This edition, updated by Arlene O&#39;Sean and Antoinette Schleyer of the American Mathematical Society, brings Ms. Swanson&#39;s work up to date, reflecting the more technical reality of publishing today.

Most disheartening is that he is interested only in publishing first and exhibits little patience for the kind of meticulous attention to detail that guarantees the accuracy of his results.

The authors chart every stage of research, from finding a topic and generating research questions about it to marshalling evidence, constructing arguments, and writing everything up in a final report that is a model of authority. Their advice is designed for use by both beginners and seasoned practitioners, and for projects from class papers to dissertations.<br><br>This book is organized into four parts. Part One is a spirited introduction to the distinctive nature, values, and protocols of research. Part Two demystifies the art of discovering a topic.

Parts Three and Four cover the essentials of argument&#x2014;how to make a claim and support it&#x2014;and ways to outline, draft, revise, rewrite, and polish the final report. Part Three is a short course in the logic, structure, uses, and common pitfalls of argumentation.

Yet essential as research is to the ultimate success of your work, performing it is not an innate talent. The precepts, steps, and skills of solid research are readily acquired if you spend some time with <i>The Craft of Research</i> before you start on your outlines and thesis statements. Written by three distinguished professors in 1995, published by the University of Chicago, and winner of the 1995-96 Critics' Choice Award, <i>The Craft of Research</i> teaches how to plan, carry out, and report on research for any field and at any level. Aimed at assisting student researchers, from raw beginners to accomplished graduate and professional students, the book shows how to choose a topic, plan and organize research, and how to draft and revise a report of findings such that a convincing solution is offered to a significant problem.<p> <i>The Craft of Research</i> is more than just another instruction manual getting you from topic to outline to notes to report. Recognizing that good research is rarely a simple, sequential procedure, but is instead a complex and intricate process, it discusses the subtle ways in which asking questions about your topic can influence how you draft your report, how a quality introduction can send you back to the library, and how the process of drafting can highlight flaws in your argument that need to be addressed.

This section is brought up to date with new information on the role of the Internet in research, including how to find and evaluate sources, avoid their misuse, and test their reliability.<br><br>Part 3 explains the art of making an argument and supporting it. The authors have extensively revised this section to present the structure of an argument in clearer and more accessible terms than in the first edition. New distinctions are made among <i>reasons</i>, <i>evidence</i>, and <i>reports of evidence</i>. The concepts of <i>qualifications and rebuttals</i> are recast as <i>acknowledgment and response</i>.

Foods with fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and the critically important omega-3 fatty acids? Or foods without them? Startling research in the journal <i>Food Review</i> shows that today a full 50 percent of the vegetables we eat consist of the trimmings on a hamburger and a side of fries. <br> Most people today know that nutrition and health are related. We have heard that poor nutrition plays a role in cardiovascular disease and cancer, but what about other conditions? Is it an underlying factor in depression, anxiety, multiple scleroris, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, migraine headaches, ADHD, and more? And, if so, what can we do about it? <br> <i>The Brain Diet</i> explains the connection between diet, mental health, and realizing the full potential of our intelligence. It shows how poor nutrition adversely affects our mental health and success, and what can be done to achieve our full intellectual capacity (and to help our children do the same). <br> Despite being just 2 percent of total adult weight, the human brain demands an enormous amount of energy and an ample flow of blood for it to work most effectively. Our ability to think, to reason, to create art and music, to develop technology and perform complex work, and much more is at stake in what we eat. <i>The Brain Diet</i> explains the science behind how our brains function and provides suggestions for eating a healthy diet. <br> Included are the basics of a brain-healthy diet, brain-healthy recipes, helpful charts, and food supplements that enhance our mental function (and the science behind how they work). A revolutionary new way of looking at mental health and intelligence, <i>The Brain Diet</i> gives new meaning to the adage, "You are what you eat."</p><p><b>Alan C.

The flower became even more popular with artists after Freud provided a sexual interpretation of its form that added new levels of meaning to depictions of it. The calla lily soon became a recurring motif in works by important painters and photographers, particularly Georgia O'Keeffe, who depicted the flower so many times and in such provocative ways that by the early 1930s she became known as "the lady of the lilies." <p>This gorgeous book features 54 paintings, photographs, and drawings of the calla lily dating from the 1860s to 1940. It includes nine of O'Keeffe's most renowned paintings of the flower as well as works by Imogen Cunningham, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, John La Farge, Man Ray, Joseph Stella, and Edward Weston. The book includes an introduction by esteemed O'Keeffe scholar Barbara Buhler Lynes and essays on various aspects of the flower in American art by Charles C. Eldredge and James Moore. </p><p>This book is the catalogue for an exhibition at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum from October 3, 2002 to January 14, 2003, which will then travel to the Albuquerque Museum from February 1 to May 1, 2003 and the Muscarelle Museum of Art in Williamsburg, Virginia, from May 31 to August 10, 2003.</p></p><p>Published in association with the Georgia O&#39;Keeffe MuseumBarbara Buhler Lynes is curator at the Georgia O&#39;Keeffe Museum and the Emily Fisher Landau Director of the Georgia O&#39;Keeffe Museum Research Center: She is the author of Georgia O&#39;Keeffe Catalogue Raisonne, published by Yale University Press.

This biography is theologically unbiased and is written as much for historians and general readers as for those interested in Calvin the Church reformer.</p><p>History occasionally produces figures whose influence on their own and successive generations is immense. Marx, Freud and Lenin had such an influence, and so, Alister McGrath argues, does John Calvin. This book provides a fresh and lucid exploration of Calvin's life and influence, his theology and his political thought, and his determining of the course of European history. It traces Calvin's remarkable impact on the development of modern Western attitudes to work, wealth, civil rights, capitalism and the natural sciences. <p>Published to wide critical acclaim in hardback and now available in paperback, this ground-breaking study of Calvin will be welcomed by all concerned with an understanding of the shaping of modern western culture.</p><b>Alister E.

Fermentation is examined fully and includes a lengthy look at the factors affecting malo-lactic fermentation and its pros and cons. There is a huge chapter on cellar operations that deals with racking, stabilization, fining, filtration, blending and maintaining winery hardware, followed by sections on barrelling and bottling.

Using a wide range of sources&#x2015;archaeology, legal texts, grave goods, technology, art, and writings in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin&#x2015;she challenges traditional assumptions regarding Judaism's historical development.<br><br>Following the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple by Roman armies in 70 C.E., new incarnations of Judaism emerged. Of these, rabbinic Judaism was the most successful, becoming <i>the</i> classical form of the religion. Through ancient stories involving Jewish spinners and weavers, Peskowitz re-examines this critical moment in Jewish history and presents a feminist interpretation in which gender takes center stage. She shows how notions of female and male were developed by the rabbis of Roman Palestine and why the distinctions were so important in the formation of their religious and legal tradition.<br><br>Rabbinic attention to women, men, sexuality, and gender took place within the "ordinary tedium of everyday life, in acts that were both familiar and mundane." While spinners and weavers performed what seemed like ordinary tasks, their craft was in fact symbolic of larger gender and sexual issues, which Peskowitz deftly explicates. Her study of ancient spinning and her abundant source material will set new standards in the fields of gender studies, Jewish studies, and cultural studies.</p><p>"Peskowitz weaves rabbinic rhetoric, archaeological data, and critical theory into a detailed cultural map of Roman-period Judaism. Impressively documented, compellingly argued, this work demonstrates through its particular attention to the ordinary&#x2015;work, tools, bodies, gossip, the minutiae of everyday life&#x2015;how gender was constructed, maintained, and ultimately naturalized. A brilliant work from a major new voice, <i>Spinning Fantasies</i> is an interdisciplinary masterpiece."&#x2015;A.J. Levine, Vanderbilt University<br><br>"The reader will never look at the texts explicated in this work in the same way again. Jews and Christians alike will be fascinated by the notions of gender that cut across religions in antiquity.

The book portrays Mao as a monster &#x2013; equal to or worse than Hitler and Stalin &#x2013; and a fool who won power by native cunning and ruled by terror. It received a rapturous welcome from reviewers in the popular press and rocketed to the top of the worldwide bestseller list. Few works on China by writers in the West have achieved its impact. </p> <p></p> <p>Reviews by serious China scholars, however, tended to take a different view. Most were sharply critical, questioning its authority and the authors&#x2019; methods , arguing that Chang and Halliday&#x2019;s book is not a work of balanced scholarship, as it purports to be, but a highly selective and even polemical study that sets out to demonise Mao. </p> <p></p> <p>This book brings together sixteen reviews of <em>Mao: The Unknown Story</em> &#x2013; all by internationally well-regarded specialists in modern Chinese history, and published in relatively specialised scholarly journals. Taken together they demonstrate that Chang and Halliday&#x2019;s portrayal of Mao is in many places woefully inaccurate. While agreeing that Mao had many faults and was responsible for some disastrous policies, they conclude that a more balanced picture is needed.</p></p><p><p><strong>Gregor Benton</strong> is Professor of Chinese History at Cardiff University.

Beginning with the American Indian migration throughout the United States, the book discusses the variety of Indian cultures that Europeans encountered, incorporating the most recent literature on the subject. As in earlier editions, the fourth edition integrates the experiences of racial, religious, and national minorities, explaining how their histories intertwined with the emergence of modern America. It also explores the far-reaching implications of recent immigration laws, presenting the controversy over multiculturalism in terms of understanding American history. The authors conclude with reflections on where the nation stands today as an ethnically and racially diverse society. <br> For the fourth edition, Dinnerstein, Nichols, and Reimers have made extensive revisions. While the previous editions used economic development to organize and tell the history of America's multicultural society, this text focuses much more on ethnic groups themselves, the roles the groups played in American social developments, and the impact of economic changes on ethnicity. In addition, the authors include more information on the post-1960 period, particularly in regard to immigration and American Indians. They have expanded the discussion of the meaning of such terms as "white" and "people of color" and have updated all content--especially information on gender, Indian-white contact, and cultural history--by incorporating new findings from recent scholarship. This new edition contains extensive statistics culled from the recently available 2000 U.S. Census report; it features an explanation of what these latest figures indicate about America's ethnic makeup and revised tables and graphs that reflect this new data. <em>Natives and Strangers, 4/e</em>, is ideal for undergraduate courses covering immigration, American social history, and American ethnic groups.</p><p>Leonard Dinnerstein and Roger L.

Her father. That&#x2019;s right&#x2014;and teen health expert Dr. Meg Meeker has the data and clinical experience to prove it. After more than twenty years of counseling girls, she knows that fathers, more than anyone else, set the course for their daughters&#x2019; lives.

Directly challenging the feminist attack on traditional masculinity, Dr. Meeker demonstrates that the most important factor for girls growing up into confident, well-adjusted women is a strong father with conservative values. To have one, she shows, is the best protection against eating disorders, failure in school, STDs, unwed pregnancy, and drug or alcohol abuse&#x2014;and the best predictor of academic achievement, successful marriage, and a satisfying emotional life.

The secrets of the Aymara civilization, one of thefirst great empires of the Americas, have only recently beendeciphered from the haunting ruins of their splendid temples, amongwhich their contemporary descendants still live and worktoday.<br> <br> In Valley of the Spirits, Alan Kolata takes us deep into themystical world of the Aymara, where past and present come togetherand the spirits of ancient ancestors still speak to shamans in thevoices of mountain springs. Kolata's unique knowledge of the Aymarais based on 17 years of research at the site of the ancientempire.<br> <br> Its crown jewel was the dazzling ancient capital of Tiahuanaco,whose gold and silver-appointed temples and "monumental stonesculptures intensified the mythic aura of the city, imbuing it witha quality of the supernatural." From A.D. 400-1100, it was thespiritual center of the Andean world. According to Aymara myth, thecreator god Viracocha brought man to life from the springs androcks of Tiahuanaco's sacred landscape.<br> <br> The city's rich symbolism linked man inextricably to the majesticplan--and the cyclical fates--of nature. Royal priests performedelaborate animal and human sacrifices and buried human trophy headsand the mummified remains of Aymara kings in lavish religiouspageants. So impressive was the legacy of Tiahuanaco that the Incarulers claimed descent from the Aymara kings more than 500 yearsafter the empire's mysterious catastrophic demise.<br> <br> Kolata deciphers the mysteries of the ancient monuments, from themassive Akapana pyramid, the symbol of sacred mountains, and offertility and abundance, to the imposing archway known as theGateway of the Sun, among the most exquisite artistic monuments ofthe ancient Americas. And he takes us into the contemporary worldof the Aymara as well, where shamans recite the names of ancestralspirits in a hypnotic protocol of remembrance and homage to LadyEarth and Lord Sky.<br> <br> "To anyone fascinated by the total experience of humans, to anyonewho wishes to go beyond the familiar world, to anyone wanting topush the envelope of their own perceptions, a sojourn into the mindand history of the Aymara is disturbing, exhilarating, andultimately unforgettable."--Alan Kolata, in his Introduction toValley of the Spirits</p><p>A millennium before the Incas built their empire, the city of Tiahuanaco sat at the center of a great empire of its own. Located on Lake Titicaca, the world&#39;s highest at 13,000 feet, in what is now Bolivia, at the very limits of agriculture, the people of Tiahuanaco developed an ingenious system of cultivation based on raised planting beds alternating with trenches that served as irrigation ditches. From A.D. 400 to 800, the temples of Tiahuanaco glittered with gold and the empire supported as many as 250,000 people. Kolata, who has spent more than 17 years excavating the empire&#39;s ruins, weaves together the story of Tiahuanaco and the region&#39;s modern inhabitants, the Aymara.A fascinating firsthand account of the author&#39;s work exploring the past and present of the Aymara Indian&#39;s empire that was wealthier and larger than those of the Incas and Mayans. Covers the 15,000 year history of the Aymara civilization detailing its art, politics, religion and commerce. Describes the uplifting story of how Kolata has helped contemporary descendants rediscover their ancient past and reclaim their native culture.

Jeffrey T. Schnapp introduces the book, elaborating the cultural and historical context of Ball's work and situating Hammer's work in relation to Dada. In a concluding essay, Hammer probes various aspects of Ball's asceticism, spirituality, and sexuality to arrive at a revisionist interpretation of Zurich Dada and the origins of modernism as well as postmodern art-making.</p></p><p>&#34;Jonathan Hammer brings passion and obsession, a sharply tuned intellect, and fresh and vivid focus to his translation of Ball&#39;s text and to a parallel world of images.

Here, in the first history of this great urban landmark, Gail Fenske argues that its design serves as a compelling lens through which to view the distinctive urban culture of Progressive-era New York.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fenske shows here that the building&#x2019;s multiplicity of meanings reflected the cultural contradictions that defined New York City&#x2019;s modernity. For Frank Woolworth&#x2014;founder of the famous five-and-dime store chain&#x2014;the building served as a towering trademark, for advocates of the City Beautiful movement it suggested a majestic <i>hotel de ville</i>, for technological enthusiasts it represented the boldest of experiments in vertical construction, and for tenants it provided an evocative setting for high-style consumption. Tourists, meanwhile, experienced a spectacular sightseeing destination and avant-garde artists discovered a twentieth-century future. In emphasizing this faceted significance, Fenske illuminates the process of conceiving, financing, and constructing skyscrapers as well as the mass phenomena of consumerism, marketing, news media, and urban spectatorship that surround them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the representative example of the skyscraper as a &#x201c;cathedral of commerce,&#x201d; the Woolworth Building remains a commanding presence in the skyline of lower Manhattan, and the generously illustrated<i> Skyscraper and the City </i>is a worthy testament to its importance in American culture.<i></i></p><p><b>Gail Fenske </b>is professor of architecture at Roger Williams University."In this superb, deeply nuanced study, Gail Fenske weaves the complex processes, multiple collaborations, and competing agendas that combined to produce a single landmark into a compelling analysis of the interplay between architecture, consumer culture, and the dynamically changing city. Both sharply focused and broad in its implications, The Skyscraper and the City reveals as much about the modern urban landscape as it does about the Woolworth Building itself."-Kate Solomonson, author of The Chicago Tribune Tower Competition<br><br>"Fenske's impressively comprehensive, contextual, and deeply researched account of the making of the Woolworth Building weaves together the histories of the client, the architect, and the building itself, including design, construction, technology, and representation. It is also about the city, and no other architectural history reveals so well what it means to build a major commercial building in New York City." (Thomas Bender, author of The Unfinished City )<br><br>"After nearly a century, the Woolworth Building has finally found a worthy chronicler. In this book Gail Fenske describes the remarkable mix of architectural skill, business savvy and unbounded ambition that led to the creation of one of the largest and most conspicuous monuments of American 20th century culture. The story of businessman Frank Woolworth, his architect, Cass Gilbert, and the thousands of other individuals who came together to create this astonishing `cathedral of commerce' is an absorbing and highly revealing tale, and Fenske tells it very well."-Robert Bruegmann, author of Sprawl: A Compact History (Robert Bruegmann, author of Sprawl: A Compact History )</p><h2>The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic (Oxford Handbooks)</h2><p>Mathematics and logic have been central topics of concern since the dawn of philosophy. Since logic is the study of correct reasoning, it is a fundamental branch of epistemology and a priority in any philosophical system. Philosophers have focused on mathematics as a case study for general philosophical issues and for its role in overall knowledge- gathering. Today, philosophy of mathematics and logic remain central disciplines in contemporary philosophy, as evidenced by the regular appearance of articles on these topics in the best mainstream philosophical journals; in fact, the last decade has seen an explosion of scholarly work in these areas.<br> <br> This volume covers these disciplines in a comprehensive and accessible manner, giving the reader an overview of the major problems, positions, and battle lines. The 26 contributed chapters are by established experts in the field, and their articles contain both exposition and criticism as well as substantial development of their own positions. The essays, which are substantially self-contained, serve both to introduce the reader to the subject and to engage in it at its frontiers. Certain major positions are represented by two chapters--one supportive and one critical.<br> <br> <em>The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Math and Logic</em> is a ground-breaking reference like no other in its field. It is a central resource to those wishing to learn about the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of logic, or some aspect thereof, and to those who actively engage in the discipline, from advanced undergraduates to professional philosophers, mathematicians, and historians.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stewart Shapiro</strong> is O'Donnell Professor of Philosophy at The Ohio State University and Professorial Fellow at the Arch� Centre, University of St. Andrews.<br><br>"<em>The Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic</em> is a very accessible, wide ranging work that serves not only to indicate the 'state of the art' in the given area, but, remarkably, also serves as a very fine introduction to the field. I recommend it highly, both to workers in the given field and, equally, to the 'general philosopher,' regardless of one's main area." --<em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of Mathematics and Logic</em> is most certainly here to stay for a very long time. The quality of each of the contributions is reflected in the authors' stimulating writing. The handbook can add substantially to the emerging thoughts and studies on the subject."--<em>Current Engineering Practice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Confucian Perfectionism: A Political Philosophy for Modern Times (The Princeton-China Series, 6)</h2><p><p>Since the very beginning, Confucianism has been troubled by a serious gap between its political ideals and the reality of societal circumstances. Contemporary Confucians must develop a viable method of governance that can retain the spirit of the Confucian ideal while tackling problems arising from nonideal modern situations. The best way to meet this challenge, Joseph Chan argues, is to adopt liberal democratic institutions that are shaped by the Confucian conception of the good rather than the liberal conception of the right.</p><br><br><p> <i>Confucian Perfectionism</i> examines and reconstructs both Confucian political thought and liberal democratic institutions, blending them to form a new Confucian political philosophy. Chan decouples liberal democratic institutions from their popular liberal philosophical foundations in fundamental moral rights, such as popular sovereignty, political equality, and individual sovereignty. Instead, he grounds them on Confucian principles and redefines their roles and functions, thus mixing Confucianism with liberal democratic institutions in a way that strengthens both. Then he explores the implications of this new yet traditional political philosophy for fundamental issues in modern politics, including authority, democracy, human rights, civil liberties, and social justice.</p><br><br><p> <i>Confucian Perfectionism</i> critically reconfigures the Confucian political philosophy of the classical period for the contemporary era.</p></p><p><p>"This splendid book makes a powerful case that Confucianism has much to contribute to contemporary political thought and practice the world over. With clear and careful argumentation, Chan shows that Confucian perfectionist ideals retain their attractiveness in the present day and that new kinds of institutions are needed to best realize these ideals in our modern world."<b>--Stephen C. Angle, Wesleyan University</b></p><p>"Joseph Chan is one of the most sophisticated and insightful people working not only to understand traditional Confucian political philosophy but also to develop it as a powerful and attractive view for the modern world."<b>--Philip J. Ivanhoe, City University of Hong Kong</b></p><p>"This book introduces an exciting new element to contemporary democratic theory--the integration of key concepts drawn from Confucianism and adapted for the modern world. With its stimulating arguments, the book has the potential to have great influence in Asia and shake up democratic theory in the West."<b>--Jane Mansbridge, Harvard Kennedy School</b></p><p>"This original and important book is a fresh effort to use Confucian ideas to help us recognize, understand, and perhaps, address problems in our own democracy."<b>--Archon Fung, Harvard Kennedy School</b></p><b>Joseph Chan</b> is a professor in the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong.</p><h2>Drug Information Handbook for Oncology</h2><p><p><strong>Overview</strong><br>The<i>Lexicomp Drug Information Handbook for Oncology</i>supports the needs of oncology professionals involved in prescribing, preparing, and administering therapy.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong><br>This handbook provides healthcare professionals with vital information on antineoplastic agents, ancillary medications, combination chemotherapy regimens, and dosing protocols.

Barnes (1872&#x2015;1951). <em>Art Held Hostage</em> is now updated with a new epilogue by the author covering the current state of this international treasure and the endless battle over its fate. 8 pages of photographs</p><p><i>Art Held Hostage</i> reveals the messy inside story about the most infamous world-class art museum that you&#x2019;ve probably never heard of. The saga begins with the life and times of Albert C. Barnes, a Philadelphia business magnet who, after making his fortune during the Depression, becomes one of America&#x2019;s most important collectors of impressionist and post-impressionist art. The collection includes famed paintings by such luminaries as Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, and Renoir. Barnes became well known for his harsh personality and instigated a problematic invitation-only policy to his museum, located in a Philadelphia suburb. Strangely, even after Barnes&#x2019; death the museum continued to become embroiled in financial, legal, and community disputes. The story gets uglier during the 1990s with a series of lawsuits for the foundation&#x2019;s high-profile president, including a racial discrimination suit and eventually near-bankruptcy for the collection. Author John C. Anderson, a contributing editor of <i>The American Lawyer</i> magazine, spares no cynical detail in his investigation into this truly American tale of power, litigiousness, and boardroom antics.

Marks illustrates the symbiotic relationship between the history of modern drug regulation and the history of therapeutic reform. Accompanying this history of public policy is a detailed account of changing experimental ideals and practices. Marks traces the history of therapeutic experimentation, from the &#34;collective investigations&#34; of the past century to the controlled clinical trial that emerged after 1950 as the paradigm of scientific experimentation. The result is the first general history of clinical research in the United States, a book that examines therapeutic experiments in a wide range of diseases, from syphilis and pneumonia to heart disease and diabetes.</p><p>How do we evaluate the safety and benefit of new drugs? What tasks do we hold government responsible for and which ones do we leave to the medical profession? This book explores the origins of our contemporary system of drug regulation and of the modern clinical trial. Harry Marks looks at the science and politics of drug evaluation, tracing the history of therapeutic experimentation from the &#34;collective investigations&#34; of the last century to the modern-day controlled clinical trial, while exploring the influence of academic ideal on governmental drug regulation.What kinds of tests should be performed on a drug before its release? What kinds of professional skills are most appropriate for performing such tests, and how safe must a drug be before it is marketed? Harry Marks, a medical historian at Johns Hopkins University, shows that none of these questions are new; issues of authority, risk, and benefit have been raised since early in the 20th century, when the new "wonder drugs" gave hope that diseases would succumb to the weight of laboratory science.<p> The primary focus of the book is on the post-World War II era, when randomized clinical trials became the gold standard of clinical drug research. Historians and clinicians have tended to regard the introduction of powerful new statistical methods as part of the march of science, but Marks shows that this progress was not achieved without resistance. Much of the resistance stemmed from the requirement that large-scale drug tests be conducted according to standardized experimental protocols, a requirement that many physicians saw as compromising the doctor-patient relationship. </p><p> The point of the new experimental designs was to diminish bias (both "profligate" administration of drugs by physicians and exaggerated claims by drug manufacturers), but many physicians also resented the push for statistical controls, insofar as it diminished their discretion in deciding how to treat their patients. The Veterans Administration's 1947 experiments to test the therapeutic value of streptomycin against advanced tuberculosis, for example, ran up against the concern that the untreated controls would be deprived of the benefits of the drug. Many Veterans Administration physicians were not eager to treat their patients as experimental subjects, and the decision was eventually made to abandon the use of untreated controls. Marks does not mention it, but the timing of the decision (September 1947) suggests that ethical questions raised by the Nuremberg medical trials may have contributed to the decision. </p><p> The introduction of double-blind experiments shortly thereafter led to new kinds of ethical quandaries. Marks concentrates on two studies that ran into difficulties, for rather different reasons. The ambitious Diet-Heart Study, designed to assess the effects of fats and meats on arteriosclerosis, came to a premature end when it was realized that the people under study might alter their diets as new evidence of health effects came to be publicized. The University Group Diabetes Program ran into a different kind of problem when it turned out that patients receiving one of the study drugs (tolbutamide) were dying of heart disease at higher rates than patients in a control group. Those in charge of the study had to wrestle with an entirely new kind of ethical question in the context of clinical trials -- namely, how much evidence of the harm of a drug is required to halt a study. </p><p> The book is heavily documented, almost overly so. Footnotes occupy about half the text, giving it something of the flavor of an annotated bibliography or a doctoral thesis. There are also points where one wishes the topic could have been brought up to date. There are many ongoing controversies over the value of "evidence-based" medicine, fraud, and statistical standardization that deserve historical scrutiny. There is some discussion -- though more would have been better -- about efforts by consumer activists (largely inspired by the AIDS epidemic) to "fast-track" the process of drug approval, as well as recent congressional mandates to include women and minorities in clinical trials. </p><p> Marks's book is slow going at first, but the chapters on the struggles to introduce randomized clinical trials are impressive. The book is sure to change how we regard the origins of clinical trials; it also asks us to broaden our understanding of experimental ethics and to question the political effects of different kinds of disciplinary authority. Marks shows once again that there is no single voice for science, but also that statistical designs can never substitute for political engagement when it comes to the kinds of therapies we decide to bar or allow. There is no better history of the complex weave of science, politics, and ethics in the design of therapeutic research protocols. </p><p> <i>Reviewed by Robert N.

Hebb's, <i>The Organization of Behavior</i> has been one of the most influential books in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. <br> <br> <i>The Organization of Behavior</i> played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. <br> <br> D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. <br> <br> References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology--a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.<br></p><p><p><i>Undergraduates and graduate students required to read an out-of-print <i>The Organization of Behavior</i> should be very grateful to Richard Brown and Peter Milner for their efforts in re-publishing this seminal book.

The work provides a complete theory of emotional processes, explaining how different emotions are elicited and expressed, and how the emotional range of individuals develops over their lifetime. The author's approach puts emotion in a central role as a complex, patterned, organic reaction to both daily events and long-term efforts on the part of the individual to survive, flourish, and achieve. In his view, emotions cannot be divorced from other functions--whether biological, social, or cognitive--and express the intimate, personal meaning of what individuals experience. As coping and adapting processes, they are seen as part of the ongoing effort to monitor changes, stimuli, and stresses arising from the environment. After defining emotion and discussing issues of classification and measurement, Lazarus turns to the topics of motivation, cognition, and causality as key concepts in this theory. Next he looks at individual emotions, both negative and positive, and examines their development in terms of social influences and individual events. Finally, he considers the long-term consequences of emotion on physical health and well-being, and the treatment and prevention of emotional dysfunction. The book draws together the relevant research from a wide variety of sources, and distills the author's pioneering work in the field over the last forty years. As a comprehensive treatment of the emotions, the book will interest students, clinicians, and researchers involved in personality, social and clinical psychology, as well as cognitive and developmental psychology. It may also be used as a supplemental textbook in courses on the psychology of adjustment, emotion, and feeling.<br></p><p>Richard S. Lazarus is at University of California at Berkeley (Emeritus).<br>Advance praise: "This volume is certainly the magnum opus of Lazarus' distinguished career.

Beck, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania<p></p><br>"The book is a masterpiece. Novel and well-written, it contains the most thorough and thoughtful treatment of emotion presented by anyone anywhere. The concept of core relational themes is a major breakthrough in our understanding of the generation of affect. Especially important are the treatment of unconscious processes in emotion, and the discussion of the development of cognition-emotion relationships.

The outlines of his 'cognitive-motivational-relational' theories are broad and sweeping, yet the detailed findings on which his views are based provide a stunning rationale for those views. It has been Lazarus' achievement to discern with remarkable acumen the interaction between cognition, motivation and cultural transactions in giving shape to our emotional lives. His espousal of concepts like appraisal and 'meaning-making' has changed the way psychologists look at emotion." --Jerome Bruner, Ph.D., Research Professor of Psychology, New York University<p></p><br>"This latest contribution by one of our most seminal scholars addresses the formidable task of reintegrating emotion into our conceptualization of human adaptation. The results, in this volume, are remarkable. <em>Emotion and Adaptation</em> is both far ranging in scope and manifests the depth of Lazarus' scholarship. His reasoning is clear, the material well documented and appropriately illustrated. Equally impressive is the simplicity and even humor of his writing style. This is an edifying and important work. It will have a significant impact on our thinking." --Carl Eisdorfer, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chairman, Department of Psychiatry, Professor of Psychology, University of Miami<p></p><br>"Thoughtful, scholarly, provocative, with many theoretical and practical implications.

Maxwell's latest book will enhance the lives of leaders, professionals, and anyone who wants to achieve success and personal growth.</b><br><br> <b></b>We often treat the word <i>capacity</i> as if it were a natural law of limitation. Unfortunately, most of us are much more comfortable defining what we perceive as off limits rather than what's really possible. Could it be that many of us have failed to expand our potential because we have allowed what we perceive as <i>capacity</i> to define us? What if our limits are not really our limits? <br><br> In his newest book, John Maxwell identifies 17 core capacities. Some of these are abilities we all already possess, such as energy, creativity and leadership. Others are aspects of our lives controlled by our choices, like our attitudes, character, and intentionality. Maxwell examines each of these capacities, and provides clear and actionable advice on how you can increase your potential in each. He will guide you on how to <i>identify</i>, <i>grow,</i> and <i>apply </i>your critical capacities. Once you've blown the "cap" off your capacities, you'll find yourself more successful--and fulfilled--in your daily life.</p><p>JOHN C.

He carefully selected Tony Award-winning stars who have spent the majority of their careers in theater, leaving aside those who have moved on or occasionally drop back in. The women he interviewed spent endless hours with him, discussing their careers, offering insights into the iconic shows, changes on Broadway over the last century, and the art (and thrill) of taking the stage night after night. Chita Rivera describes the experience of starring in musicals in each of the last seven decades; Audra McDonald gives her thoughts on the work that went into the five Tony Awards she won before turning forty-one; and Carol Channing reflects on how she has revisited the same starring role generation after generation, and its effects on her career. Here too is Sutton Foster, who contemplates her breakout success in an age when stars working predominately in theater are increasingly rare. Each of these conversations is guided by Shapiro's expert knowledge of these women's careers, Broadway lore, and the details of famous (and infamous) musicals.

They were drawn by the beauty of this picturesque village and its surrounding countryside, and by the presence of Calude Monet who had settled there in 1883. The link between the master of Impressionism and the new arrivals was strong: not only did Monet influence their painting style, but socially the artists lived in a close-knit community, enjoying moments of relaxation together before or after long hours spent at the easel.<br><br>For the first time, this book tells the little-known story of the everyday life of this community: daily meetings at the tennis courts; entertaining in the Butler household (Theodore Butler married Monet's daughter); and the central role played by the H�tel Baudy.

Pharmacology is the scientific study of drugs, including their composition, uses, and physiological effects. While not traditionally taught to organic and medicinal chemists, an understanding of pharmacology is becoming essential for maintaining the dynamic role of the drug development researcher. Pharmacologic texts are usually organized around the practice of clinical medicine or classes of drugs; this book uses chemistry as its foundation.</p><p>Joseph G. Cannon is Professor Emeritus of Medicinal Chemistry in the College of Pharmacy of the University of Iowa, Iowa City.<br>"Assuming no background in physiology or pharmacology, this practical guide covers the aspects of pharmacology most important and useful to organic chemists engaged in drug discovery. Cannon (medicinal chemistry, University of Iowa) based the book on the three-day ACS short course he has taught for 20 years, but adds more detailed discussions, references, and definitions. The first part explains the chemical and biological bases of pharmacology. The remainder of the book addresses specific categories of drugs, and demonstrates how the concepts and phenomena previously described can be exploited to rationalize the experimentally observed pharmacology of the drugs."--<em>SciTech Book News</em><p></p><br>"In the preface, Cannon explains that many PhD-prepared chemists enter the pharmaceutical industry without any knowledge of the clinical use or physiology behind the very drugs they will be designing or improving. His book is an outgrowth of a course designed to acquaint these individuals with pharmacology in terms of anatomy and physiology, certain disease processes, and clinical treatment. . . . The book reads easily and is clearly laid out. The diagrams and flowcharts add a significant element to the book. What is most interesting is that this book serves two purposes: while educating graduate-level chemists about the pharmacology of the drugs they know chemically, it can also serve as a chemistry primer for the health-care worker. With a small background in biochemical functions, the health care worker will be able to glean significant understanding from the text.

The pain of that eventual separation is the cruel corollary to the love we share with them, and most of us deal with it by simply ignoring its inevitability.</p> <p> </p> <p>With <i>The Last Walk</i>, Jessica Pierce makes a forceful case that our pets, and the love we bear them, deserve better. Drawing on the moving story of the last year of the life of her own treasured dog, Ody, she presents an in-depth exploration of the practical, medical, and moral issues that trouble pet owners confronted with the decline and death of their companion animals. Pierce combines heart-wrenching personal stories, interviews, and scientific research to consider a wide range of questions about animal aging, end-of-life care, and death. She tackles such vexing questions as whether animals are aware of death, whether they're feeling pain, and if and when euthanasia is appropriate. Given what we know and can learn, how should we best honor the lives of our pets, both while they live and after they have left us? </p> <p><br> The product of a lifetime of loving pets, studying philosophy, and collaborating with scientists at the forefront of the study of animal behavior and cognition, <i>The Last Walk</i> asks&#x2014;and answers&#x2014;the toughest questions pet owners face. The result is informative, moving, and consoling in equal parts; no pet lover should miss it.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Jessica Pierce</b> is a bioethicist and coauthor of <i>Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals</i>.</p>"Jessica Pierce takes a brave and honest look at the hardest decision all of us who share our lives with dogs must face--whether and when to put to sleep, put down, euthanize, terminate, kill our boon companions.&nbsp;She does not make it easier--it never gets easier--but she does succeed in cutting through the euphemistic&nbsp;obfuscation that so often obscures every aspect of the subject." (Mark Derr, author of How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends)<br><br><p>"Decisions about how to treat an animal toward the end of her or his life are among the most difficult we have to make and it's our responsibility to do the best we can. Our companions trust that we will have their best interests in mind.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<i>The Last Walk</i>, Jessica Pierce considers all of the hard questions about sick and old animals. She seamlessly weaves in personal stories with scientific research to provide readers with an incredibly valuable guide--a must read--about when and how to end an animal's life in the most humane way possible. I learned a lot from reading this book, and I know others will as well."</p> (Marc Bekoff, author of The Emotional Lives of Animals)<br><br><p>"<i>The Last Walk</i>&nbsp;is an engaging tribute to the complexity of human relations to companion animals and the range of issues and concerns that arise for us as those companions' lives come to their ends. The nature of building relationships and forming families with companion animals who, in most cases, we know we will outlive, shapes those relationships in profound ways. Given the subject matter, it seems odd to say I 'enjoyed' this book--I was so moved by it at times that I wept--let me say instead that I was utterly gripped by this book and think it is a must read for everyone who shares their lives with animals."</p> (Lori Gruen, author of Ethics and Animals: An Introduction)<br><br><p>"In <i>The Last Walk</i> bioethicist Jessica Pierce covers virtually every aspect of dealing with the aging and death of a companion animal&#x2014;from doggie diapers to the morally complex and psychologically wrenching decision to euthanize a pet. This is an intelligent and deeply moving book that everyone who loves&#x2014;or will love&#x2014;an aging animal should read."</p> (Hal Herzog, author of Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat)<br><br><p>"<i>The Last Walk</i> rings with compassion for aging animals and charts a hopeful&nbsp;new course for those of us who care for them. With&nbsp;her&nbsp;beautiful 'Ody's journal' passages, Jessica Pierce&nbsp;made me feel close to her beloved and&nbsp;high-maintenance old dog. It was through Ody's challenges, and Pierce's on his behalf,&nbsp;that I came to grapple in important new ways with issues of pet aging and death.&nbsp;This book is revolutionary, and &nbsp;I loved it with all my heart."</p> (Barbara J. King, author of Being with Animals)<br><br><p>"Pierce has made an important contribution to the small body of literature dealing with aging and death in companion animals. . . .

These seminars and workshops have given physicians, clergy, counselors, nurses, and volunteers a tool to take back with them to facilitate their interactions with the critically and terminally ill. Our beginnings and lessons from the dying patients have been published in <i>On Death and Dying</i> and <i>Questions and Answers on Death and Dying.</i> For those who are not familiar with this material, the first chapters will repeat some of this material in order to present the remainder of the book in a more,comprehensible fashion.<br><br>It is important to understand that the material herein is not really new. Yet there are millions of people who still have the illusion that a patient is "better off" if surrounded with an air of "all is well"; that is, if we visit terminally ill patients only with a smile on our face and cheerful, superficial conversation or silence. We have no problems getting them the very best in physical care and attention, but most often neglect their more painful emotional and spiritual turmoil.<br><br>Our work has included a total care of every need the dying may have. We have allowed them to be in control of the time and place of this care, of the amount of pain medication they require to allow them to remain conscious and alert, yet pain-free. We have respected their wishes to leave a hospital when there was no more active treatment available. We have helped in making arrangements to transport them home. We have always prepared the families for this change in their routine living and naturally spent time with the children who were affected by the sight, the smell (at times), and the communications and experiences of living in the same household with a dying parent, sibling, or other relative. We found it to be a profound and positive experience for most people, young and old -- as long as our help and assistance was available and an occasional house call on my behalf alleviated the anxieties of the family.<br><br>Case Presentation of L.<br><br>L. was a thirteen-year-old girl whose big dream in life was to be a teacher. She was hospitalized during the summer and was found to have an abdominal tumor. After surgery the parents were reassured that everything malignant had been removed, and they were confident that their daughter's life was no longer in danger. Before school started L. developed new symptoms, and by September she began to deteriorate rapidly. It became clear that she was full of metastasis and that she would no longer be able to return to school. In spite of the pleas of her parents, her physician refused to put her on Brompton mixture for pain relief, and a search for a new physician who was willing to use this most effective oral pain management was in vain. She was no longer able to be transported to Chicago, where her previous treatment was given. It was at this point that I was consulted and started to see the young patient and her family in their home.<br><br>The mother, an open, deeply religious and courageous woman, spent much time with her daughter and discussed frankly all issues that her child brought up. L. was in a comfortable bed in the living room so that she was able to participate passively in the activities of her family. Her father, a quiet man, did not speak much about her illness or impending death but showed his love and affection in little extra attention and would often return from work with a bouquet of roses for his oldest daughter.<br><br>The siblings, ranging from six to ten, were brought together one day in the living room after school hours. I had a session with them in the absence of any adults. We used the spontaneous drawings of children, a technique taught by Susan Bach, and they happily cooperated and explained their pictures. Their drawings clearly indicated their knowledge of their sister's serious illness, and we discussed her impending death without euphemisms. It was the six-year-old who had the courage to bring up his problems, namely his inability to watch television, to bang doors, and to bring friends home after school. He felt intimidated by the adults, who started to tiptoe around the house, and wondered Openly how long this ordeal might last. Together the children discussed the things they would like to share with their sister -- all the things they would like to say to her prior to her death -- and, needless to say, we encouraged them to do so without delay.<br><br>After several difficult days -- each one expected to be the last -- L. simply lingered on. By now she had an enormously enlarged abdomen and her arms and legs were similar to the ones I had seen in the concentration camps. L. simply could not die. We brought her tapes of favorite music; her mother sat many hours at her bedside and was quite open to answer whatever questions her daughter had. It seemed impossible to figure out what held this little girl to life.<br><br>During one of my house calls -- and with the mother's permission and in her presence -- I asked her straightforwardly, "L., is there something that prevents you from letting go? You cannot die, and I cannot figure out what it is. Can you tell me?" With great relief L. confirmed this by saying, "Yes, I cannot die because I cannot go to heaven." I was shocked by this statement and asked her who in the world had told her this. She then related that she was told "many times by my priest and the visiting sisters" that "no one goes to heaven unless they loved God more than anyone else in the world." With her last physical strength, she leaned forward, put her fragile arms around my shoulders, and whispered apologetically, "You see, I love my mommy and daddy more than anyone else in the world."<br><br>My initial reaction was one of anger. Why do people who "represent God" use fear and guilt instead of representing Him as God of love and mercy? I also knew from past experiences that no one can help another person by demeaning another person's approach. This is the time when the use of parables or symbolic language is the only answer. The following dialogue took place:<br><br>"L., I will not get into a debate about who has the right answers about God. Let us talk about the things we always shared. Let us take your school as an example and answer me one single question. Sometimes your teacher gives especially tough assignments to some students in class. Does she give this to her worst students, to just anyone in her class, or to only very few, especially chosen ones?" L.'s face lit up and she said very proudly, "Oh, she gives this only to very few of us." My response to her: "Since God is also a teacher, do you think He has given you an easy assignment that He can give to just any child, or has He given you an especially difficult one?" A very moving, nonverbal communication took place at this time. She leaned up for a moment and took a long, hard look at her own emaciated body, her protruding abdomen, her skinny arms and legs, and with the most extraordinarily pleased look she stared at me and exclaimed, "I don't think He could give a tougher assignment to any child." It was no longer necessary for me to say, "And now what do you think He thinks of you?"<br><br>I made only one more house call. L. was at peace. She dozed off and on and listened to some of her favorite songs, including the one I brought for her from the Monks of the Weston Priory, "Wherever You Go," which has become one of the favorites of my patients. When she died, her family was prepared. The children came with me alone to the funeral home prior to the official visiting hours and they were most grateful that they were allowed to touch her body, ask questions, and say a last prayer for their beloved sister.<br><br>Death came early in their life, but it was a shared and moving experience to see a whole family growing closer together and sharing not only the pain and agony but also the joy, the music, the drawing, and the growth experience together. It happened at home, where everybody became a part of the experience and no one felt left out, as is the case when a child is removed from home and dies -- so often alone -- in a hospital, where children are not allowed to participate and are often left with guilt, sorrow, and many unanswered questions.<br><br>This case points out several issues that we have to be willing to face if we are to have the courage and conviction to be nonconformists and accept this fact: There are many people in the helping profession who are very reluctant to accept changes brought about by the new approach to dying patients.<br><br>There is no need to suffer incredible pain now that the Brompton mixture is available. There is no need to have a mother give around-the-clock injections for pain relief to her adolescent child, for whom this is painful and who is already reduced to "skin and bone."<br><br>Aside from the issue of pain relief, the next most important problem all of us have to face is the fact that each one of us is convinced of the benefit of our work. Otherwise we naturally could not spend 90 percent of our waking hours in this field. It is our belief, our faith and conviction, and, last but not least, the positive feedback of hundreds of families that affirm us. It would be easy to say, "This is <i>the</i> way to take care of dying patients."<br><br>In spite of the fact that we strongly believe in our approach, we have to keep in mind that we can never help another human being by discrediting another fellowman. As much as I am appalled by accounts and experiences of my patients and their families, it is a golden rule that we avoid, whenever possible, negative judgment of others even if we are in disagreement with their counsel.<br><br>The case of L. perhaps shows best how the use of the symbolic language, of speaking in parables, will help to answer the patient. It also demonstrates not getting involved in a form of power struggle and competition that can only bring about more hostility and negativity.<br><br>This is not to say that we should not take every opportunity to share with such an individual later and privately our positive experiences. Slowly but surely more people will see the benefit of this approach and gradually become familiar with it.<br><br>In the meantime we have to make every human effort to teach not only adults but children, at a young age, that we can express our feelings openly and unashamedly, that there are people around who will express their opinion and understand them without the need to judge and label and discredit them.<br><br>If fears, like the one mentioned by L., can be elicited early in life and dealt with before a terminal illness strikes, we have found a way to preventive psychiatry. A group of six children, ranging in age from six to thirteen, have been confronted with their biggest fears and problems in a psychodrama setup, led by a small group of extremely well-trained adults who have worked with me in our life, death, and transition workshops. It was one of the most moving experiences that anyone who has been in the field of psychiatry and psychology for decades can witness.<br><br>It is most moving to see how children in a safe and accepting, nonjudgmental environment can open up and verbally express their deepest concerns. It is touching to see a nine-year-old finally find the courage to ask his mother, "Then why in the world did you bother to adopt me when you are so full of hate?" As a result of this openness, the other participants felt free enough to express their fears that they might not be loved or that maybe "my parents are not my real parents."<br><br>Our Growth and Healing Centers across the country, which are in a <i>status nascendi</i> at the time of this writing, will enable us to get to children of all ages and help them with these fears early in life.<br><br>B. is another case that could have ended in great guilt and tragedy if a friend had not intervened and assisted a young family to take the patient home and resolve the unfinished business virtually on the last day of her life.<br><br>I am using this example to show that children and adults have to be assisted in expressing their negative feelings and fears, resulting in a catharsis and an openness hardly ever possible during the restricting visiting hours in a hospital, where there is a lack of privacy and the ominous absence of young children.<br><br>Case Presentation of B.<br><br>B. was a young mother of two children, aged one and three years old. She had remarried when her little girl was two years old and expected a baby when her health began to fail. Shortly after the delivery of a little baby boy, she was diagnosed as having cancer and she spent much of her remaining life in and out of hospitals. Her young husband was not prepared to face all these new responsibilities: the care of two small children, the hospital bills, an empty house, dealing with neighbors and friends that he suddenly depended on, and most of all -- he resented not having a wife and a "normal life." He had no one to confide in and held it all inside -- until one day a few days prior to his wife's death, he lost his apparent composure and blurted out his dismay and anger at the world, God, and especially his wife. B., too weak to respond and unable to do much about her family situation, began to panic. She felt stuck in a hospital where treatment had already been discontinued, where the bills mounted, where she was unable to see her children. She knew that her husband threatened to put her little ones up for adoption, and she was desperate to see to it that it was prevented. It was at this time that a girlfriend visited her, evaluating the situation appropriately and fortunately taking action immediately. After a consultation with B.'s physician, she was given permission to take her home. Friends contributed the necessary tools, from a hospital bed to a commode and a rubber ring. B.'s living room was converted into a sickroom. She was placed under the living-room window, where she was able to look out into the street and the garden. She was able to view the open kitchen and her children playing. Her husband was grateful to be spared returning to an empty house after work. A brief visit to their home revealed a very lonely man who never had any opportunity to share his own fears and feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. He was more than cooperative and quite willingly allowed me to sit with the little ones at the kitchen table, explaining death to them in a language that a three-year-old could understand. We drew cocoons and butterflies, and I told them that their mommy would soon die but that this was very much like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon.<br><br>We called her parents and sat in a circle around her bed. It was the little girl who broke the ice. Sitting on my lap in front of her mother, she asked three questions, each of them revealing how much this little girl really understood, each also allowing the adults to speak openly and frankly about their unfinished turmoil.<br><br>"Dr. Ross, do you think it is all right if I go to bed tonight and pray to God that He takes my mommy now?"<br><br>"Yes, y...</p><h2>Becoming an Art Teacher</h2><p>This book introduces the student to the field of teaching, discusses theory and practice of Art Education, and synthesizes and prepares students to make the transition from student to Art teacher.

In 1928, he visited Paris for the first time and fell in with a number of avant-garde writers and artists, including James Joyce. In 1937, he settled in Paris permanently. Beckett wrote in both English and French, though his best-known works are mostly in the latter language. A prolific writer of novels, short stories, and poetry, he is remembered principally for his works for the theater, which belong to the tradition of the Theater of the Absurd and are characterized by their minimalist approach, stripping drama to its barest elements. In 1969, Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and commended for having "transformed the destitution of man into his exaltation." Beckett died in Paris in 1989.<br><br>At the age of seventy-six he said: "With diminished concentration, loss of memory, obscured intelligence... the more chance there is for saying something closest to what one really is. Even though everything seems inexpressible, there remains the need to express. A child need to make a sand castle even though it makes no sense. In old age, with only a few grains of sand, one has the greatest possibility." (from <i>Playwrights at Work</i>, ed. by George Plimpton, 2000)</p><h2>Leibniz: Determinist, Theist, Idealist</h2><p>Legendary since his own time as a universal genius, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) contributed significantly to almost every branch of learning, from mathematics to ecumenical theology. But the part of his work that is most studied today is probably his writings in metaphysics, which have been the focus of particularly lively philosophical discussion in the last twenty years or so.<br><br>Leibniz's writings in metaphysics contain one of the great classic systems of modern philosophy, but the system must be pieced together from a vast and miscellaneous array of manuscripts, letters, articles, and books, in a way that makes especially strenuous demands on scholarship. This book presents an in-depth interpretation of three important parts of Leibniz's metaphysics, thoroughly grounded in the texts as well as in philosophical analysis and critique. The three areas discussed are the metaphysical part of Leibniz's philosophy of logic, his essentially theological treatment of the central issues of ontology, and his theory of substance (the theory of monads).<br></p><p>Legendary since his own time as a universal genius, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) contributed significantly to almost every branch of learning.

The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, &#34;Our Mutual Friend revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap&#39;s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights &#34;Noddy&#34; Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes &#34;the Golden Dustman.&#34; Charles Dickens&#39;s last complete novel, &#34;Our Mutual Friend encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, &#34;Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens&#39;s most complex--and satisfying--novels.</p><h2>Drawing and Painting Animals: How to Capture the Essence of Wildlife Art</h2><p>Offers step-by-step lessons on painting and drawing wildlife with tips on materials, drawing or painting on location, the painting process, and techniques, such as, composition, design, lighting, and color</p><p></p><h2>Complete Ghost Stories (Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p>&#x201c;In another infinitesimal flash he had taken it in. Pale, dusky skin, covering nothing but bones and tendons of appalling strength; coarse black hairs, longer than ever grew on a human hand; nails rising from the ends of the fingers and curving sharply down and forward, grey horny and wrinkled. He flew out of his chair with deadly inconceivable terror at his heart.&#x201d; The art of telling a ghost story is a refined one and Montague Rhodes James was a master of it. With gentle cunning, he draws the reader into a narrative that at first seems innocuous, but that by gentle turns becomes darker and darker until he transfixes you with his prose, creating the most unforgettable, alarming, and frightening images. This volume contains all his timeless masterpieces from the four collections of his eerie tales: <i>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</i> (1904), <i>More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</i> (1911), <i>A Thin Ghost and Others</i> (1919), and <i>A Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories</i> (1925).</p><p><b>Montague Rhodes James</b> was born in 1862 at Goodnestone Parsonage, Kent, where his father was a curate, but the family moved soon afterward to Great Livermere in Suffolk. James attended Eton College and later King&#x2019;s College Cambridge where he won many awards and scholarships. From 1894 to 1908, he was director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and from 1905 to 1918, was Provost of King&#x2019;s College. In 1913, he became vice chancellor of the university for two years. In 1918 he was installed as Provost of Eton. A distinguished medievalist and scholar of international status, James published many works on biblical and historical antiquarian subjects. He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1930. His ghost story writing began almost as a divertissement from his academic work and as a form of entertainment for his colleagues. He never married and died in 1936.</p><h2>100 Ways to Improve Your Writing</h2><p>This is the one guide that anyone who writes--whether student, business person, or professional writer--should put on the desk beside pencil, pen, typewriter, or word processor.

While many have seen the 1970s as simply a period of failures epitomized by Watergate, inflation, the oil crisis, global unrest, and disillusionment with military efforts in Vietnam, Thomas Borstelmann creates a new framework for understanding the period and its legacy. He demonstrates how the 1970s increased social inclusiveness and, at the same time, encouraged commitments to the free market and wariness of government. As a result, American culture and much of the rest of the world became more--and less--equal. Borstelmann explores how the 1970s forged the contours of contemporary America. Military, political, and economic crises undercut citizens' confidence in government. Free market enthusiasm led to lower taxes, a volunteer army, individual 401(k) retirement plans, free agency in sports, deregulated airlines, and expansions in gambling and pornography. At the same time, the movement for civil rights grew, promoting changes for women, gays, immigrants, and the disabled. And developments were not limited to the United States. Many countries gave up colonial and racial hierarchies to develop a new formal commitment to human rights, while economic deregulation spread to other parts of the world, from Chile and the United Kingdom to China. Placing a tempestuous political culture within a global perspective, The 1970s shows that the decade wrought irrevocable transformations upon American society and the broader world that continue to resonate today.<br></p><p><p>"The United States and the world have become more integrated and diverse during the last several decades, and this book helps us understand how that transformation came about. Borstelmann locates the origins of the contemporary world in the 1970s and presents by far the most comprehensive and persuasive portrait of that decade. Ranging from politics and ideology to economic globalization and religious fundamentalism, this book makes compelling reading."<b>--Akira Iriye, Harvard University</b></p><p>"With brilliant insight and elegant, lively prose, Thomas Borstelmann makes sense of the seemingly incomprehensible contradictions and complexities of the 1970s. Demonstrating how the United States became both more and less equal, and linking this development to international trends, Borstelmann offers a magisterial global study of a decade that profoundly transformed America and the world. A must-read for anyone who wants to understand our past and present."<b>--Elaine Tyler May, author of <i>America and the Pill: A History of Promise, Peril, and Liberation</i></b></p><p>"This fascinating and important book shows how the United States simultaneously embraced both egalitarian norms and market principles in the 1970s--resulting in the paradoxical emergence of greater diversity and inclusivity right in tandem with soaring economic inequality. Profoundly thoughtful and beautifully written, <i>The 1970s</i> makes the compelling case that this pivotal decade gave birth to our contemporary political and social life."<b>--Suzanne Mettler, Cornell University</b></p><p>"The importance of the 1970s in explaining contemporary America and large parts of the world cannot be overstated. Borstelmann makes a clear and compelling point about how the decade's developments shaped or played out over the remainder of the century and beyond. The breadth of the book's material is extremely impressive and utterly up-to-date."<b>--Thomas Bender, author of <i>A Nation Among Nations</i></b></p><p>"Offering a wide-ranging, general history of the United States in the 1970s, this book brings together a wealth of information, a lively and accessible style, and a persuasive thematic frame. There is no better introduction to this crucial and turbulent decade."<b>--Daniel T. Rodgers, Princeton University</b></p><b>Thomas ("Tim") Borstelmann</b> is the Elwood N. and Katherine Thompson Distinguished Professor of Modern World History at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p><h2>Sensation and Perception</h2><p>Written by acclaimed researcher and teacher <b>Steven Yantis</b>, <i><b>Sensation and Perception</b></i> shows students how scientists investigate and understand sensory and perceptual phenomena today. Like no other textbook for the course, it integrates classic and current research&#x2014;including the latest developments in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging&#x2014;into a highly accessible portrait of the field&#x2019;s defining principles and experiments. Engagingly written, filled with outstanding art (including 3-D images), and supported by dozens of interactive visual demonstrations devised by the author, it is your students&#x2019; gateway to the forefront of research in sensation and perception.</p><p>STEVEN YANTIS is Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, USA. He received a PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Michigan in 1985, and following a year as postdoctoral fellow at Stanford, he joined the JHU faculty in 1986. His research interests focus on cognitive control and selective attention during multitasking by measuring both behavior (response time, eye movements) and brain activity (functional MRI). He received the Early Career Award from the American Psychological Association in 1994 and the Troland Research Award from the National Academy of Sciences in 1996.&#39;There are many strengths: pedagogical features such as the vignettes and interspersed review questions. The Applications section at the end of each chapter is a great idea. The book is well-written and probably at just about the right level for my students.&#39; - Dan Swift, University of Michigan-Dearborn, USA &#39;This is a clearly written text that does an excellent job of presenting classic topics in the field of Sensation and Perception in the context of current research methodology and findings.

But are its analyses of inequality and economic growth on target? Where should researchers go from here in exploring the ideas Piketty pushed to the forefront of global conversation? A cast of economists and other social scientists tackle these questions in dialogue with Piketty, in what is sure to be a much-debated book in its own right.</p><p><i>After Piketty</i> opens with a discussion by Arthur Goldhammer, the book&#x2019;s translator, of the reasons for <i>Capital</i>&#x2019;s phenomenal success, followed by the published reviews of Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Robert Solow. The rest of the book is devoted to newly commissioned essays that interrogate Piketty&#x2019;s arguments. Suresh Naidu and other contributors ask whether Piketty said enough about power, slavery, and the complex nature of capital. Laura Tyson and Michael Spence consider the impact of technology on inequality. Heather Boushey, Branko Milanovic, and others consider topics ranging from gender to trends in the global South. Emmanuel Saez lays out an agenda for future research on inequality, while a variety of essayists examine the book&#x2019;s implications for the social sciences more broadly. Piketty replies to these questions in a substantial concluding chapter.</p><p>An indispensable interdisciplinary work, <i>After Piketty</i> does not shy away from the seemingly intractable problems that made <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century </i>so compelling for so many.</p></p><p><p>Heather Boushey is Executive Director and Chief Economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and former Chief Economist on Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s transition team. She is the author of <i>Finding Time: The Economics of Work-Life Conflict</i> and coeditor of <i>After Piketty: The Agenda for Economics and Inequality</i> (both from Harvard). The <i>New York Times</i> has called Boushey one of the &#x201c;most vibrant voices in the field&#x201d; and <i>Politico</i> twice named her one of the top 50 &#x201c;thinkers, doers, and visionaries transforming American politics.&#x201d;</p><p>J. Bradford DeLong is Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Marshall Steinbaum is Fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, New York.</p>&#x201c;The book serves as a fantastic introduction to Piketty&#x2019;s main argument in <i>Capital</i> [<i>in the Twenty-First Century</i>], and to some of the main criticisms, including doubt that his key equation&#x2015;<i>r</i> &gt; <i>g</i>, showing that returns on capital grow faster than the economy&#x2015;will hold true in the long run. It also contains thoughtful interventions in debates about the political economy of inequality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Aaron Reeves</b><b>, </b><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Boushey, DeLong, and Steinbaum] have curated an impressive set of essays responding to Piketty&#x2019;s work...Among them are deep dives into the assumptions underlying Piketty&#x2019;s predictions, historical accounts of the role of slavery and gender in capitalist systems, and considerations of the relationship between concentrated wealth and political power. The essays put Piketty&#x2019;s arguments into a broad historical and intellectual context and highlight some noteworthy omissions that call into question his book&#x2019;s most dire predictions. At the end of the volume, Piketty himself weighs in. The result is an intellectual excursion of a kind rarely offered by modern economics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Melissa S. Kearney</b><b>, </b><b><i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The essays in <i>After Piketty</i> are impressively diverse, not only in their subject matter but also in the way they relate to Piketty&#x2019;s original text.

They repeat themselves rarely; they examine multiple different perspectives; and most of them are well and conservatively argued...[Piketty&#x2019;s concluding essay] is written with great attention to criticism and humility about his conclusions. In it, Piketty insists that [<i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i>&#x2019;s] purpose was to start a conversation. By the evidence of his concluding essay, and the book in general, that conversation is well underway.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mihir S. Sharma</b><b>, </b><b><i>Business Standard</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book, edited by economists Heather Boushey, J. Bradford Delong and Marshall Steinbaum, is more interesting than the original. It benefits from having 21 essays on different inequality-�related topics. As Piketty says in his gracious response, included at the end of this 660-�page volume, the many authors bring a welcome breadth of expertise...Piketty&#x2019;s commentators raise more questions than they answer, but they are important questions about a significant social challenge.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edward Hadas</b><b>, </b><b><i>Breakingviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Piketty&#x2019;s work did what decades of rising disparities couldn&#x2019;t do: it reminded macroeconomists that inequality matters. More starkly, it laid bare just how ill-equipped our existing frameworks are for understanding, predicting, and changing inequality. This extraordinary collection shows that our most nimble social scientists are responding to the challenge, collecting ideas about capital, technology, power, gender, race, and privilege that might help inform a broader understanding.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Justin Wolfers, University of Michigan</b><br><br>&#x201c;Thomas Piketty&#x2019;s <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i> forcibly entered the public imagination in 2014, but the book&#x2019;s impact on academic thinking and research is only just starting to be felt. The essays in <i>After Piketty</i> offer new findings and admirably lay out an agenda that will influence future research on inequality, opportunity, and measurement for years to come.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Miles Corak, University of Ottawa</b><br><br>&#x201c;Heather Boushey, Brad DeLong, and Marshall Steinbaum have convened and shaped an ambitious and refreshingly frank conversation about Thomas Piketty&#x2019;s <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i>. This extraordinary gathering of two dozen authors&#x2015;working across disciplinary boundaries&#x2015;interrogates Piketty&#x2019;s core claims about the causes, correlates, characteristics, and consequences of high and rising levels of income and wealth inequality in the West. The gathered authors celebrate and hone <i>Capital</i>&#x2019;s far-reaching contributions; they also tackle substantial weaknesses and assess omissions. Readers unfamiliar with <i>Capital</i> will find an accessible synthesis, graduates of the original book will emerge with a more nuanced understanding, and inequality scholars&#x2015;newcomers and veterans&#x2015;will revise their research agendas.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Janet C. Gornick, Professor of Political Science and Sociology, Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality, City University of New York</b></p><h2>Looking for The Stranger: Albert Camus and the Life of a Literary Classic</h2><p><p><i>The Stranger</i> is a rite of passage for readers around the world. Since its publication in France in 1942, Camus&#x2019;s novel has been translated into sixty languages and sold more than six million copies. It&#x2019;s the rare novel that&#x2019;s as at likely to be found in a teen&#x2019;s backpack as in a graduate philosophy seminar. If the twentieth century produced a novel that could be called ubiquitous, <i>The Stranger</i> is it.<br> <br> How did a young man in his twenties who had never written a novel turn out a masterpiece that still grips readers more than seventy years later? With <i>Looking for &#x201c;The Stranger&#x201d;</i>, Alice Kaplan tells that story. In the process, she reveals Camus&#x2019;s achievement to have been even more impressive&#x2014;and more unlikely&#x2014;than even his most devoted readers knew.<br> <br> Born in poverty in colonial Algeria, Camus started out as a journalist covering the criminal courts. The murder trials he attended, Kaplan shows, would be a major influence on the development and themes of <i>The Stranger</i>. She follows Camus to France, and, making deft use of his diaries and letters, re-creates his lonely struggle with the novel in Montmartre, where he finally hit upon the unforgettable first-person voice that enabled him to break through and complete <i>The Stranger</i>.<br> <br> Even then, the book&#x2019;s publication was far from certain. France was straining under German occupation, Camus&#x2019;s closest mentor was unsure of the book&#x2019;s merit, and Camus himself was suffering from near-fatal tuberculosis. Yet the book did appear, thanks in part to a resourceful publisher, Gaston Gallimard, who was undeterred by paper shortages and Nazi censorship. <br> <br> The initial critical reception of <i>The Stranger</i> was mixed, and it wasn&#x2019;t until after liberation that <i>The Stranger</i> began its meteoric rise. As France and the rest of the world began to move out of the shadow of war, Kaplan shows, Camus&#x2019;s book&#x2014; with the help of an aggressive marketing campaign by Knopf for their 1946 publication of the first English translation&#x2014;became a critical and commercial success, and Camus found himself one of the most famous writers in the world. Suddenly, his seemingly modest tale of alienation was being seen for what it really was: a powerful parable of the absurd, an existentialist masterpiece.<br> <br> Few books inspire devotion and excitement the way <i>The Stranger</i> does. And it couldn&#x2019;t have a better biographer than Alice Kaplan, whose books about twentieth-century French culture and history have won her legions of fans. No reader of Camus will want to miss this brilliant exploration.<br> </p></p><p><b>Alice Kaplan</b> is the author of numerous books, including <i>Dreaming in French</i>, <i>The Interpreter, French Lessons</i>, and <i>The Collaborator</i>, the last of which was a finalist for the National Book Award.<br> &nbsp;"To this new project, Kaplan brings equally honed skills as a historian, literary critic, and biographer. . . . In an epilogue, Ms. Kaplan goes a step further and looks for the identity of the Arab involved in the real-life altercation that inspired the novel's pivotal scene. What she learns about him is fascinating, and how she writes about parallels between him and Camus is a lovely example of her own imaginative powers and stylish prose. . . . Reading <i>The Stranger</i> is a bracing but somewhat bloodless experience. Ms. Kaplan has hung warm flesh on its steely bones." (John Williams <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Fascinating. . . . Engrossing." (<i>Library Journal, starred review</i>)<br><br>"A first-rate acount, rich in intriguing details." (<i>Weekly Standard</i>)<br><br>"An absorbing account of the making of <i>The Stranger</i>. For American readers, few French novels are better known, and few scholars are better qualified than Kaplan to reintroduce us to it. The author of several fine biographies of French and American writers, as well as the ravishing memoir <i>French Lessons</i>, Kaplan here sets herself the task of writing a biography of a book. . . . Kaplan tells this story with great verve and insight, all the while preserving the mystery of its creation and elusiveness of its meaning. . . . While some might question Kaplan&#x2019;s claim that the novel 'changed the course of modern literature' few will ever question either the work's perennial appeal or the brilliance with which Kaplan has told its story." (Robert Zaretsky <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Kaplan's research is exhaustive (she includes an extensive bibliography), her tone is conversational, and her analyses convincing and often surprising. . . . Kaplan is a superb storyteller. One of the best chapters of the book, 'Gallimard's War', reads like a philosophical thriller with its Nazi censors, misunderstandings, and moral conundrums. Yet, through all this she never loses focus on the novel to which her book is dedicated. . . .&nbsp; Equally engaging are her chapters documenting the initial reception of the book in both the French- and English-speaking world. . . . Surely destined to become the quintessential companion to Camus's most enduring novel." (<i>PopMatters</i>)<br><br>"The fascinating story behind Albert Camus' coldblooded masterpiece. . . . A swiftly told, deeply researched literary investigation. . . . While she doesn't offer any final interpretation, her detective work deepens the understanding of a work whose power resides as much in what it doesn't say as what it does. A compelling companion to a novel that has stayed strange." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Splendid." (<i>Jane Ciabattari, BBC Culture</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Kaplan&#x2019;s history charts the success of Camus&#x2019;s debut novel, which is an astonishing tale. It was published in the most unpropitious circumstances, during the Nazi Occupation. Kaplan is particularly brilliant at showing the ways in which the novel was refracted in reading. <i>L&#x2019;�tranger</i> has been called a &#x2018;colonial allegory, an existential prayer book, an indictment of conventional morality, a study in alienation, or a Hemingway rewrite of Kafka&#x2019;"<br> &nbsp; (<i>Spectator</i>)<br><br>"Stellar. . . . A fascinating mix of straight fact--she names the bells that inspired the one that rings in the novel's verdict scene--and astute psychological inference.&nbsp;. . . &nbsp;Though it's left unsaid,&nbsp;<i>Looking for The Stranger</i> is also a wistful reminder of the vital role novels and criticism played in our culture not so very long ago (<i>The Stranger</i>&nbsp;went on to sell millions after Sartre endorsed it in a review)--a role that's sadly almost unimaginable today."

Defiantly, Giles sets up a pest-house, where the afflicted might be cared for and separated from the rest of the populace in an attempt to contain the epidemic.&nbsp;</p><p>As the seaport descends into panic, religious fervor, and mob rule, bizarre occurrences ensue:&nbsp; the harbormaster&#x2019;s family falls victim to the fever, except for his son, Leander Hatch, who is taken in at the Sumner mansion and a young woman, Marie Montpelier, is fished out of the Merrimac River barely clinging to life, causing Giles and Enoch&#x2015;who is convinced she&#x2019;s the expatriate daughter of the French king&#x2015;to vie for her attentions--all while medical supplies are pillaged by a black marketer from Boston.&nbsp; As the epidemic grows, fear, greed, and unhinged obsession threaten the Sumner family&#x2015;and the future of Newburyport itself.</p></p><p>John Smolens&nbsp;is author of&nbsp;Cold, The Invisible World, Fire Point,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Anarchist.&nbsp;He received his MFA from the University of Iowa in 1984 and is currently head of the MFA program at Northern Michigan University.&nbsp; His novel&nbsp;The Schoolmaster's Daughter&nbsp;will be published by Pegasus Books in paperback in September, 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can visit his site at&nbsp;www.johnsmolens.com.The Miranda arrives in the bustling port of Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1796, with half its crew either suffering or dead from a mysterious illness. Dr. Giles Wiggins, who learned his trade on the battlefield, orders the ship to be placed under quarantine, but a few unruly sailors refuse to be confined and slip into town. Within days, many of the town&#x2019;s residents sicken and die, and Wiggins orders the construction of a pesthouse for the afflicted in an effort to stop the spread of the disease. Then the town&#x2019;s apothecaries are raided, and the medicine stolen sold on the black market at enormous profit, while the sick go untreated. Wiggins finds himself at odds with his colleagues, with one claiming the disease is divine retribution, while the other asserts that the fever can be treated through bloodletting. With a fascinating cast of characters, including Wiggins&#x2019; obnoxious half brother and fearsome mother; a vividly rendered depiction of the era; and a stark look at the primitive state of medicine at the time, Quarantine is an intense read. --Joanne Wilkinson</p><h2>Hey, Kids! Come Craft with ME</h2><p>The warm, nostalgic motifs of Mary Engelbreit, now American classics, tuck neatly into the lives of today&#x2019;s kids. They&#x2019;ll eagerly work on every craft project, which is sure to spark their imagination and self-expression.<p>More than 30 children&#x2019;s crafting projects inspired by Mary Engelbreit&#x2019;s motifs and sentiments.</p><p>The only children&#x2019;s crafting book from Mary Engelbreit.</p><p>Research shows that Mary Engelbreit crafts rate very high among crafters and that her designs are popular among kids.</p><p>Step-by-step photographs and instructions.</p><p>Full-color photos, including some showing children using the projects.</p><p>Designed for children 6 to 14.</p><p>Easier crafts for younger children.</p><p>Shows variety of techniques.</p></p><p>Mary Engelbreit's whimsical and brightly colored style is a natural for kid-oriented crafts. Geared to 6- to 14-year-olds, this delightful book opens with a pep talk encouraging her young fans to carve out a little workspace for themselves and get creative. Kids can decorate their rooms, their stuff, and themselves with these cute and clever ideas, making fun accessories, wild dress-up clothes, funky gifts and stationery, bedroom-brightening organizers, scrapbooks, and lots more. Most of the projects require only minimal adult involvement, if any, and the supplies are generally basic craft-store items. So that no mistakes stand in the way, the "Oh No" suggestion boxes explain how to cope with boo-boos like splotched paint on the wrong part of the project. And for the crafty child who likes a challenge, the "Miss Smarty" boxes offer options to take the project in new directions. Engelbreit may even inspire some budding artists to make drawing and crafting an integral part of their lives. <i>--Amy Handy</i>Grade 3-7-Budding Martha Stewarts will squeal over this book. The directions and photographs are clear, the supply lists are thorough, and traceable patterns are included. Alternate suggestions are given in case the project is too upscale or expensive. The first craft sets the tone. It explains how to design a special chair. After an adult has measured and determined the amount of fabric needed to cover it, children then personalize the cloth with their drawings or writings. The third and final step is for the adult to take the fabric and chair to an upholstery shop where it can be professionally covered. The backup plan should this prove to be impossible is to design a pillow or place mat instead. Fortunately, most of the following projects are less ambitious. They include nature crafts such as twig picture frames, costumes and accessories, patterns for tea-party place settings, paper crafts such as greeting cards and stationery, and dozens more. The book is loaded with ideas, many of which smack of cuteness, but they can serve as catalysts for other activities by inventive children.<br><i>Jennifer J.

Using a treasure trove of Wright family correspondence and diaries, Tom Crouch skillfully weaves the story of the airplane's invention into the drama of a unique and unforgettable family. He shows us exactly how and why these two obscure bachelors from Dayton, Ohio, were able to succeed where so many better-trained, better-financed rivals had failed. 50 b/w photographs</p><p>Tom D. Crouch, author of The Bishop's Boys and A Dream of Wings, is senior curator of the aeronautics division at the National Air &amp; Space Museum. He lives in Fairfax, Virginia.Milton Wright, father of Wilbur and Orville, was an itinerant churchman embroiled in controversies who bequeathed to his sons firmness of purpose, stubborn independence and overweening pride, qualities that were to inform their lives. After the bachelor brothers perfected the world's first practical airplane, their extreme secretiveness and haughty manner alienated potential business partners. Determined to protect their invention, the duo became litigious, undertaking a string of patent-infringement lawsuits that consumed their energies and very possibly contributed to Wilbur's death at age 45 in 1912. Orville, who finally reaped a fortune from the sale of the Wright Company, spent his last years tinkering on small-scale projects. He died in 1948. Crouch ( A Dream of Wings ) interweaves family drama with the history of aviation in a riveting saga of ingenuity, competing claims, public adulation and technical innovation. More than 10 years in the writing, with benefit of cooperation from the Wright family, this comprehensive biography throws light as well on Will and Orv's long-suffering sister Katherine, head of the household (their mother died in 1889), who held the family together while their father crisscrossed the country. The book also contains fresh glimpses of rival pioneers--American, French, German--and their magnificent flying machines.

The travelers &#x2015; noble, coarse, jolly, and pious &#x2015; offer a vibrant portrait of fourteenth-century English life. Their narratives form English literature's greatest collection of chivalric romances, bawdy tales, fables, legends, and other stories.<br><i>The Canterbury Tales</i> reflects a society in transition, as a middle class began to emerge from England's feudal system. Craftsmen and laborers ride side by side with the gentry on the road to the shrine of St. Thomas � Becket, and their discussions and arguments about ethical issues mirror their changing world. The pilgrims' conversations and stories also reveal their individual personalities, and Chaucer's vivid, realistic characterizations assured the <i>Tales</i> an instant and enduring success. Each pilgrim's story can be read separately and appreciated in its own right; all appear here in a lucid translation into modern English verse by J. U.

Rather than building and combining mechanistic models of ecosystems, the approach is grounded in information theory and the logic of inference. Paralleling the derivation of thermodynamics from the maximum entropy principle, the state variable theory of ecology developed in this book predicts realistic forms for all metrics of ecology that describe patterns in the distribution, abundance, and energetics of species over multiple spatial scales, a wide range of habitats, and diverse taxonomic groups. <br><br>The first part of the book is foundational, discussing the nature of theory, the relationship of ecology to other sciences, and the concept of the logic of inference. Subsequent sections present the fundamentals of macroecology and of maximum information entropy, starting from first principles. The core of the book integrates these fundamental principles, leading to the derivation and testing of the predictions of the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE). A final section broadens the book's perspective by showing how METE can help clarify several major issues in conservation biology, placing it in context with other theories and highlighting avenues for future research.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Harte</strong> is a Professor of Ecosystem Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.

You snatch your hand away from the hot thing immediately. Obviously. But what is really happening, biologically&#x2015;and emotionally? In <i>Understanding Pain</i>, Fernando Cervero explores the mechanisms and the meaning of pain. You touch something hot and your brain triggers a reflex action that causes you to withdraw your hand, protecting you from injury. That kind of pain, Cervero explains, is actually good for us; it acts as an alarm that warns us of danger and keeps us away from harm.</p><p>But, Cervero tells us, not all pain is good for you. There is another kind of pain that is more like a curse: chronic pain that is not related to injury. This is the kind of pain that fills pain clinics and makes life miserable. Cervero describes current research into the mysteries of chronic pain and efforts to develop more effective treatments.</p><p>Cervero reminds us that pain is the most common reason for people to seek medical attention, but that it remains a biological enigma. It is protective, but not always. Its effects are not only sensory but also emotional. There is no way to measure it objectively, no test that comes back positive for pain; the only way a medical professional can gauge pain is by listening to the patient's description of it. The idea of pain as a test of character or a punishment to be borne is changing; prevention and treatment of pain are increasingly important to researchers, clinicians, and patients. Cervero's account brings us closer to understanding the meaning of pain.</p></p><p>Fernando Cervero, President of the International Association for the Study of Pain, is Professor of Anesthesia at McGill University, where he is the Director of the Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain.<p>In <i>Understanding Pain</i>, Fernando Cervero... gives a remarkably lively tour of what we do know...

But it has never held a more important place than it does today, with both traditional problems and new topics often sparked by the developments in the psychological, cognitive, and computer sciences. Jaegwon Kim's <i>Philosophy of Mind</i> is the classic, comprehensive survey of the subject. Now in its second edition, Kim explores, maps, and interprets this complex and exciting terrain. Designed as an introduction to the field for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, <i>Philosophy of Mind</i> focuses on the mind/body problem and related issues, some touching on the status of psychology and cognitive science. The second edition features a new chapter on Cartesian substance dualism-a perspective that has been little discussed in the mainstream philosophy of mind and almost entirely ignored in most introductory books in philosophy of mind. In addition, all the chapters have been revised and updated to reflect the trends and developments of the last decade. Throughout the text, Kim allows readers to come to their own terms with the central problems of the mind. At the same time, the author's own emerging views are on display and serve to move the discussion forward. Comprehensive, clear, and fair, <i>Philosophy of Mind</i> is a model of philosophical exposition. It is a major contribution to the study and teaching of the philosophy of mind.</p><p><b>Jaegwon Kim</b> is William Perry Faunce Professor of Philosophy at Brown University. He is the author of <i>Supervenience and Mind</i> (1993) and of many important papers on the philosophy of mind, metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of science.Kim's book is the best general survey of metaphysics of mind. It brims with arresting arguments and lucid points of exposition. Kim's own philosophical judgment is not suppressed, but he gives sympathetic accounts of opposing views. Perhaps no other text accessible to undergraduates is so often consulted by professional philosophers. Most chapters have been augmented in this third edition, but its most distinctive feature is its expanded discussion of consciousness.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Bernard W.

He received his Ph.D. from The Ohio State University, where he specialized in Reformation History under Harold J. Grimm. His articles and reviews have appeared in journals such as Moreana, Journal of General Education, Catholic Historical Review, Archiv f�r Reformationsgeschichte and American Historical Review. He also has contributed chapters or articles to THE SOCIAL HISTORY of REFORMATION, THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE: A DICTIONARY HANDBOOK, the SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER ANNUAL OF HOLOCAUST STUDIES and UTOPIAN STUDIES. His work has been supported by fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation and the Foundation for Reformation Research. At Penn State, he helped inaugurate the Western Civilization course, as well as a popular course on Nazi Germany. His book HITLER AND NAZI GERMANY was published in 1987 (7th Edition, 2014).

But was he right? Can the quantum theory of fields and Einstein's general theory of relativity, the two most accurate and successful theories in all of physics, be united in a single quantum theory of gravity? Can quantum and cosmos ever be combined? On this issue, two of the world's most famous physicists--Stephen Hawking (<i>A Brief History of Time</i>) and Roger Penrose (<i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> and <i>Shadows of the Mind</i>)--disagree. Here they explain their positions in a work based on six lectures with a final debate, all originally presented at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge.</p><br><p> How could quantum gravity, a theory that could explain the earlier moments of the big bang and the physics of the enigmatic objects known as black holes, be constructed? Why does our patch of the universe look just as Einstein predicted, with no hint of quantum effects in sight? What strange quantum processes can cause black holes to evaporate, and what happens to all the information that they swallow? Why does time go forward, not backward?</p><br><p> In this book, the two opponents touch on all these questions. Penrose, like Einstein, refuses to believe that quantum mechanics is a final theory. Hawking thinks otherwise, and argues that general relativity simply cannot account for how the universe began. Only a quantum theory of gravity, coupled with the no-boundary hypothesis, can ever hope to explain adequately what little we can observe about our universe. Penrose, playing the realist to Hawking's positivist, thinks that the universe is unbounded and will expand forever. The universe can be understood, he argues, in terms of the geometry of light cones, the compression and distortion of spacetime, and by the use of twistor theory. With the final debate, the reader will come to realize how much Hawking and Penrose diverge in their opinions of the ultimate quest to combine quantum mechanics and relativity, and how differently they have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible.</p></p><p>Who doesn't love a good argument? When physics heavyweights Stephen W. Hawking and Roger Penrose delivered three sets of back-and-forth lectures capped by a final debate at Cambridge's Isaac Newton Institute, the course of modern cosmological thinking was at stake. As it happens, <i>The Nature of Space and Time</i>, which collects these remarks, suggests that little has changed from the days when Einstein challenged Bohr by refusing to believe that God plays dice. The math is more abstruse, the arguments more refined, but the argument still hinges on whether our physical theories should be expected to model reality or merely predict measurements.<p> Hawking, clever and playful as usual, sides with Bohr and the Copenhagen interpretation and builds a strong case for quantum gravity. Penrose, inevitably a bit dry in comparison, shares Einstein's horror at such intuition-blasting thought experiments as Schr�dinger's long-suffering cat--and scores just as many points for general relativity. The math is tough going for lay readers, but a few leaps of faith will carry them through to some deeply thought-provoking rhetoric. Though no questions find final answers in <i>The Nature of Space and Time</i>, the quality of discourse should be enough to satisfy the scientifically curious. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Stephen Hawking</b> is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. <b>Roger Penrose</b> is the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford. <b>Michael Atiyah,</b> Master of Trinity College Cambridge, and former President of the Royal Society, has written a foreword for this book.</p><h2>Homing Instinct: Using Your Lifestyle to Design &amp; Build Your Home</h2><p>"This is the only book to show you how to approach the design and construction of a home that's affordable, durable, environmentally sound, well-sited, beautiful, and, above all, specifically tailored to your needs." <br>--Michael J.

Master architectural fundamentals and effective building techniques.If the idea of a new house is an interesting possibility, but not yet something that occupies a large number of your waking hours, which of the several hundred books at your local bookstore will be the most helpful? <p></p> To get you started, read John Connell's <i>Homing Instinct: Using Your Lifestyle to Design and Build Your Home</i> (McGraw-Hill, 1998). The author is both an architect and the founder of Yestermorrow Design/Build School in Warren, Vermont (www.yestermorrow.org). The school runs intensive workshops in design and construction for both professionals and non-professionals. <p></p> Intended for a lay audience, Connell's book is free of jargon, and his writing is so engaging you will find yourself reading about foundations and framing with great interest, if not gusto. The sections on The Site and The Building (with chapter headings like "Walls and Wallness" and "What Works and What Doesn't: Looking at the Interconnected Effects of Gravity, Temperature, Moisture and Ethics") will be more riveting after your house starts to go up, and you want to understand what you're looking at. At the beginning stages of your new house project, the section called "The Program" will be more helpful. <p></p> To arrive at the right design for you, Connell says, you need to start with the big cosmic questions -- Who are you? Who would you like to be? -- and then gradually home in on a real house. The "Bubbles and Storyboard: Diagramming Your Program" chapter walks you through how to make a bubble diagram. Most architects in their initial discussions use these with clients to illustrate various functional relationships and how the house might relate to the site. <p></p> Many architects will caution against thinking about a design before you have a building site, but I think working out which spaces are more important to you and which ones are less so will make the architect's job easier. And once you've established what the spaces and their relationships are, these can be physically configured in any number of ways, depending on the building site you end up with.

The translator of this bilingual edition is herself a New Mexican poet whose style is uniquely suited to the hazards of translation.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. LC 92-12484I have been reading Vallejo in the original since 1970 and was persuaded to undertake the translation of this, his most difficult work, only by something analogous to a gravitational pull. My aim in translating this most difficult work was to create English poems, poems that would work in English in the same way that the original works in Spanish. Those who know Spanish have access to the original, but a translation exists to bring the work over into another tongue, to create the poem for the reader who has no access to the original. I also hoped that, in the process, I would be able to convey the multidimensionality of Vallejo&#39;s poems, and, that the reader who is able to read both English and Spanish, would hear in the dialogue between the original and my translation, another third possibility. I also hoped to place Vallejo&#39;s work into its proper context, as a work of indigenous blood, to paraphrase Vallejo himself, as aspect of his work which has been critically overlooked, despite his own words on the subject.</p><h2>DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES: A DEFENSE OF THEORY IN MEDICINE</h2><p>"<i>The Doctrine of Signatures</i><br> &nbsp; is one of the first and most significant works in our time to show how closely<br> &nbsp; connected the liberal arts are to clinical medicine.

Many computer examples integrated throughout, including random process examples in MATLAB. <b></b> Includes expanded discussions of fundamental principles, especially basic probability. Includes new problems which deal with applications of basic theory&#x2014;in such areas as medical imaging, percolation theory in fractals, and generation of random numbers. Several new topics include Failure rates, the Chernoff bound, interval estimation and the Student t-distribution, and power spectral density estimation. Functions of Random Variables is included as a separate chapter. Mean square convergence and introduction of Martingales is covered in the latter half of the book. <b></b> Provides electrical and computer engineers with a solid treatment of probability and random processes. </p></p><p><p><b>Preface</b></p> <p> The first edition of this book (1986) grew out of a set of notes used by the authors to teach two one-semester courses on probability and random processes at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). At that time the probability course at RPI was required of all students in the Computer and Systems Engineering Program and was a highly recommended elective for students in closely related areas. While many undergraduate students took the course in the junior year, many seniors and first-year graduate students took the course for credit as well. Then, as now, most of the students were engineering students. To serve these students well, we felt that we should be rigorous in introducing fundamental principles while furnishing many opportunities for students to develop their skills at solving problems. </p> <p> There are many books in this area and they range widely in their coverage and depth. At one extreme are the very rigorous and authoritative books that view probability from the point of view of measure theory and relate probability to rather exotic theorems such as the Radon-Nikodym theorem (see for example <i>Probability and Measure</i> by Patrick Billingsley, Wiley, 1978). At the other extreme are books that usually combine probability and statistics and largely omit underlying theory and the more advanced types of applications of probability. In the middle are the large number of books that combine probability and random processes, largely avoiding a measure theoretic approach, preferring to emphasize the axioms upon which the theory is based. It would be fair to say that our book falls into this latter category. Nevertheless this begs the question: why write or revise another book in this area if there are already several good texts out there that use the same approach and provide roughly the same coverage? Of course back in 1986 there were few books that emphasized the engineering applications of probability and random processes and that integrated the latter into one volume. Now there are several such books. </p> <p> Both authors have been associated (both as students and faculty) with colleges and universities that have demanding programs in engineering and applied science. Thus their experience and exposure have been to superior students that would not be content with a text that furnished a shallow discussion of probability. At the same time, however, the authors wanted to write a book on probability and random processes for engineering and, applied science students. A measure-theoretic book, or one that avoided the engineering applications of probability and the processing of random signals, was regarded not suitable for such students. At the same time the authors felt that the book should have enough depth so that students taking 2nd year graduate courses in advanced topics such as estimation and detection, pattern recognition, voice and image processing, networking and queuing, and so forth would not be handicapped by insufficient knowledge of the fundamentals and applications of random phenomena. In a nutshell we tried to write a book that combined rigor with accessibility and had a strong self-teaching orientation. To that end we included a. large number of worked-out examples, MATLAB codes, and special appendices that include a review of the kind of basic math needed for solving problems in probability as well as an introduction to measure theory and its relation to probability. The MATLAB codes, as well as other useful material such as multiple choice exams that cover each of the book's sections, can be found at the book's web site http://www.prenhall.com/stark. </p> <p> The normal use of this book would be as follows: for a first course in probability at, say the junior or senior year, a reasonable goal is to cover Chapters 1 through 4. Nevertheless we have found that this may be too much for students not well prepared in mathematics. In that case we suggest a load reduction in which <i>combinatorics</i> in Chapter 1 (parts of Section 1.8), <i>failure rates</i> in Chapter 2 (Section 2.7), <i>more advanced density functions</i> and <i>the Poisson transform</i> in Chapter 3 are lightly or not covered the first time around. The proof of the <i>Central Limit Theorem, joint characteristic functions,</i> and Section 4.8, which deals with statistics, all in Chapter 4, can, likewise, also be omitted on a first reading. </p> <p> Chapters 5 to 9 provide the material for a first course in random processes. Normally such a course is taken in the first year of graduate studies and is required for all further study in signal processing, communications, computer and communication networking, controls, and estimation and detection theory. Here what to cover is given greater latitude. If pressed for time, we suggest that the pattern recognition applications and simultaneous diagonalization of two covariance matrices in Chapter 5 be given lower preference than the other material in that chapter. Chapters 6 and 7 are essential for any course in random processes and the coverage of the topics therein should be given high priority. Chapter 9 on signal processing should, likewise be given high priority, because it illustrates the applications of the theory to current state-of-art problems. However, within Chapter 9, the instructor can choose among a number of applications and need not cover them all if time pressure becomes an issue. Chapter 8 dealing with advanced topics is critically important to the more advanced students, especially those seeking further studies toward the Ph.D. Nevertheless it too can be lightly covered or omitted in a first course if time is the critical factor. </p> <p> Readers familiar with the 2nd edition of this book will find significant changes in the 3rd edition. The changes were the result of numerous suggestions made by lecturers and students alike. To begin with, we modified the title to <i>Probability and Random Processes with Applications to Signal Processing,</i> to better reflect the contents. We removed the two chapters on estimation theory and moved some of this material to other chapters where it naturally fitted in with the material already there. Some of the material on parameter estimation e.g., the Gauss-Markov Theorem has been removed, owing to the need for finding space for new material. In terms of organization, the major changes have been in the random processes part of the book. Many readers preferred seeing discrete-time random phenomena in one chapter and continuous-time phenomena in another chapter. In the earlier editions of the book there was a division along these lines but also a secondary division along the lines of stationary versus non-stationary processes. For some this made the book awkward to teach from. Now all of the material on discrete-time phenomena appears in one chapter (Chapter 6); likewise for continuous-time phenomena (Chapter 7). Another major change is a new Chapter 9 that discusses applications to signal processing. Included are such topics as: the orthogonality principle, Wiener and Kalman filters, The Expectation-Maximization algorithm, Hidden Markov Models, and simulated annealing. Chapter 8 (Advanced Topics) covers much of the same ground as the old Chapter 9 e.g., stochastic continuity, meansquare convergence, Ergodicity etc. and material from the old Chapter 10 on representation of random processes. </p> <p> There have been significant changes in the first half of the book also. For example, in Chapter 1 there is an added section on the misuses of probability in ordinary life. Here we were helped by the discussions in Steve Pinker's excellent book <i>How the Mind Works</i> (Norton Publishers, New York, 1997). Chapter 2 (<i>Random Variables</i>) now includes discussions 6n more advanced distributions such as the Gamma, Chi-square and the Student-t. All of the chapters have many more worked-out examples as well as more homework problems. Whenever convenient we tried to use MATLAB to obtain graphical results. Also, being a book primarily for engineers, many of the worked-out example and homework problems relate to real-life systems or situations. </p> <p> We have added several new appendices to provide the necessary background mathematics for certain results in the text and to enrich the reader's understanding of probability. An appendix on Measure Theory falls in the latter category. Among the former are appendices on the delta and gamma functions, probability-related basic math, including the principle of proof-by-induction, Jacobians for <i>n</i>-dimensional transformations, and material on Fourier and Laplace inversion. </p> <p> For this edition, the authors would like to thank Geoffrey Williamson and Yongyi Yang for numerous insightful discussions and help with some of the MATLAB programs. Also we thank Nikos Galatsanos, Miles Wernick, Geoffrey Chan, Joseph LoCicero, and Don Ucci for helpful suggestions. We also would like to thank the administrations of Illinois Institute of Technology and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for their patience and support while this third edition was being prepared. Of course, in the end, it is the reaction of the students that is the strongest driving force for improvements. To all our students and readers we owe a large debt of gratitude. </p> <p> Henry Stark<br> John W.

He describes the make-up of words and how they're built from sounds and signs and put together in phrases and sentences. He examines the dynamics of conversation and the relations between the sound and meaning. He shows how languages help their users connect to each other and to the world, how they vary around the world, why they never stop changing, and that no two people speak a language in the same way. He looks at how language is acquired by infant children, how it relates to thought, and its operations in the brain. He investigates current trends and issues such as the levelling of linguistic class differences and the rise of new secret or in-group languages such as argot and teenspeak. He describes the history of writing from its origins to digital diffusion, and ends by looking at how language might have originated and then evolved among our distant hominid and primate ancestors.<br> <br>Language is crucial to every aspect of our lives whether we're thinking, talking, or dreaming. Barry Blake reveals the wonders that lie beneath the surface of everyday communication, enriching his exposition with a unique blend of anecdote and humour. His engaging guide is for everyone curious about language or who needs to know more about it.<br></p><p><br>Barry Blake has been teaching students about language for almost four decades.

What did an advertisement for a dog in the<i> Times</i> have to do with the movement of British troops into Egypt? And why did British officers suddenly become suspicious of the trousers hanging on a Belgian woman&#x2019;s washing line?<br><br> Throughout World War I, spymasters and their networks of secret agents developed many clever&#x2015;and sometimes comical&#x2015;methods of covert communication. Stacks of bread in a bakery window, puffs of smoke from a chimney, and even woolen pullovers were all used to pass on secret messages that were decipherable only to the well-trained eye. Drawing on the memoirs of eight spies, Melanie King divulges these and other tricks of the trade while sharing details from their astonishing stories. Among her informants are British intelligence officers working undercover in Germany and France, including a former Metropolitan police officer who once hunted Jack the Ripper; a German secret service officer codenamed &#x201c;Agricola;&#x201d; an American newspaperman; and an Austrian agent who disguised himself during his career as everything from a Jewish peddler to a Russian officer.<br><br> A fascinating compendium of clever and long-forgotten ruses&#x2015;interspersed with the stories of the spies themselves&#x2015;<i>Secrets in a Dead Fish</i> sheds new light on the shadowy world of Great War espionage.</p><p><b>Melanie King</b> is the author of several books, including <i>Can Onions Cure Ear-Ache?,</i> also published by the Bodleian Library.&#x201c;King has written an engaging, small format, short book about espionage during World War I. In nine chapters with pleasing illustrations and titles such as 'Tricks of the Trade,' 'The Female of the Species,' and 'Languages of Victory: Secret Codes,' she seeks to illustrate the tools and tradecraft of espionage as practiced at the time.&#x201d; (<i>Military History</i> 2015-08-13)</p><h2>From Smart to Wise: Acting and Leading with Wisdom</h2><p><b>A fresh and timely approach to nurturing wise, resilient, and flexible leadership in a world of growing complexity</b> <p>Leaders tend to obstinately stick to the leadership style that brought them most success in the past, usually one of two extreme styles: functional leadership that focuses on operational excellence or smart leadership that focuses on growth. When a leader's focus is too functional, the organization becomes introverted and can focus too much on bottom-line profitability while missing out on top-line growth opportunities. But when leaders focus too much on smart leadership, the organization may experience quick growth but lose its effectiveness quickly.</p> <p><i>From Smart to Wise</i> offers a new approach that balances the two styles to achieve a form of wise leadership that is both functional and smart. Drawing on inspiring real-life stories of historical and contemporary wise leaders such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and even Mahatma Gandhi, the authors identify six characteristics of wise leaders and offer a practical framework to help readers develop their own style of wise leadership.</p> <ul> <li>A timely and innovative approach to leadership</li> <li>Written by noted speakers who conduct dozens of keynote speeches and workshops, training thousands of people annually</li> </ul></p><p><p><b>Q &amp; A with Prasad Kaipa and Navi Radjou, authors of <em>From Smart to Wise</em></b></p> <strong>What does it mean to go from smart to wise?</strong> <p>In a leadership context, it means taking your existing smartness to the next level and beyond--not by getting smarter or thinking smarter or working smarter, but by cultivating your practical wisdom. Wisdom leverages your intelligence: your thinking and your leadership become more adaptable, broad-based, and sustainable. Wisdom gives you ethical clarity and a sense of purpose--enabling you to apply your smartness in the service of others. </p> <strong>Why should readers care about practical wisdom?</strong> <p>The world is changing very rapidly. What you learned when you went to college, when you first started in the company, or when you first became successful will no longer get you results today. In fact, your smartness of today may very well become your <em>in</em>-competence tomorrow. Being smart (even very, very smart) just isn't enough anymore. Wisdom helps broaden your perspective so you can respond to external events with poise and discernment. By bringing a balance between smartness and wisdom you can become more effective and successful.</p> <p>Our message is not that you have to give up or dial back your smartness--not at all. Rather, deliberately cultivating wisdom helps you deploy your smartness and expertise much more effectively. Not incidentally, it also allows you to achieve personal growth and bring long-lasting value to yourself, your organization, and society at large. </p> <strong>How will this book help readers move from smart to wise?</strong> <p>We'll help you assess where you are currently in your leadership evolution, and offer a six-step roadmap to monitor your progress--along with tools, a framework, and real world examples of smart, wise leaders from Alan Mulally to Ratan Tata to Wendy Kopp.</p> <p>The tools and framework will help you gain clarity about your role as a leader, allowing you to</p> <ul> <li>act in ways that are both authentic and appropriate</li> <li>delegate effectively and let others get credit</li> <li>make tough decisions without losing sleep</li> <li>lead and collaborate with people who think, feel, and act very differently from you</li> <li>foster a productive, sustainable work environment</li> </ul> <p>Our experience coaching over one hundred senior leaders and teaching these tools to thousands of executives has shown that integrating practical wisdom with business smarts will make you feel less stressed and more capable of managing change. It will help you become an ever more influential, effective leader.</p> <strong>Why did you write this book?</strong> <p>For 25 years, our work has involved studying how people learn, listen, lead, think, and create--and helping them do it better in a business context. Back then, we were involved in a project where we interviewed about 200 highly accomplished people, including Nobel laureates, CEOs, thought leaders, and athletes, exploring what qualities make them successful. We identified two pathways to success in this group: one that favors smartness and one that leads to wisdom. We found these paths are distinct but not mutually exclusive--in fact, they build on one other. But one, the "smart" path, gets more attention and accolades in today's leadership circles, even though the other, the "wise" path, makes success more sustainable.</p> <p>Since then, we've coached over one hundred senior leaders and worked in executive education settings with about forty thousand executives from all over the world. Our experience has deepened our original insights and given us vast practical experience in their application. It has become clear to us that the path of practical wisdom (incorporating both smart and wise approaches) is essential in these times of greater complexity, accelerating globalization, and rapid technology shifts. We decided to write a book that distilled our decades of work into a practical process that smart leaders could use to cultivate practical wisdom.</p><b>Praise for <i>From Smart to Wise</i></b> <p>"<i>From Smart to Wise</i> teaches the importance of working together and shows that everyone can contribute to making the world a better place."<br> &#x2014;<b>Alan Mulally</b>, president and CEO, Ford Motor Company</p> <p>"We are entering a new era of 'conscious capitalism' in which enlightened organizations will strive to serve a higher purpose that transcends profit maximization.

Early in 1944, German commander Field Marshal Erwin Rommel took one look at the gentle, sloping sands and announced "They will come here!&#x201d; He was referring to "Omaha Beach&#x201d;&#x2015;the prime American D-Day landing site. The beach was subsequently transformed into three miles of lethal, bunker-protected arcs of fire, with seaside chalets converted into concrete strongpoints, fringed by layers of barbed wire and mines. The Germans called it &#x201c;the Devil's Garden."</p><p>When Company A of the US 116th Regiment landed on Omaha Beach in D-Day&#x2019;s first wave on 6th June 1944, it lost 96% of its effective strength. Sixteen teams of US engineers arriving in the second wave were unable to blow the beach obstacles, as first wave survivors were still sheltering behind them. This was the beginning of the historic day that&nbsp;Landing on the Edge of Eternity&nbsp;narrates hour by hour&#x2015;rom midnight to midnight&#x2015;tracking German and American soldiers fighting across the beachhead.&nbsp;</p><p>Mustered on their troop transport decks at 2am, the American infantry departed in landing craft at 5am. Skimming across high waves, deafened by immense broadsides from supporting battleships and weak from seasickness, they caught sight of land at 6.15. Eleven minutes later, the assault was floundering under intense German fire. Two and a half hours in, General Bradley, commanding the landings aboard USS Augusta, had to decide if to proceed or evacuate.

I thought I had answers. I didn't know jack." </p><p>But Baldacci never looked back, and the result is <i>Inside Mrs. B's Classroom</i>, a compelling, first-hand narrative from the trenches of the inner-city school system that addresses one of society's most critical issues from gritty, daily personal experience.</p> <p>An expert on Chicago's massive education reform efforts even before she turned in her press credentials, Baldacci adds an informed, intellectual layer to this insightful, engaging work. In an era in which many people talk about wanting to make a difference, Baldacci has done so. Here she shares the whole picture, from the unrealistic expectations to the surprises--good and bad--that make up education today. Above all, she shows how an individual can, did--and continues to--make a difference in the lives of American children.</p></p><p><p><b>Leslie Baldacci </b>is still a classroom teacher and writes for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>.</p><p>Chicago's public school system in the 1980sand '90s was a stark symbol of the nation's educational crisis. Grim reflections of their poverty-stricken neighborhoods, the city's schools were saddled with severe drug problems and the inevitable violence that results. Veteran <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> journalist Leslie Baldacci was an expert on the subject. She wrote regularly on the school system's woes, calling on the mayor and other city officials to save the decaying system. Then, one day, she decided to do something about it. Baldacci traded in her press pass for a teaching certificate, and never looked back.</p><p>With high ideals and great expectations, the author was soon teaching in one of Chicago's toughest South Side neighborhoods--and quickly learned that noble ideas would go only so far. "In reality, my classroom was just one deck chair on the Titanic," she comments. Overcrowded classrooms, little if any infrastructure, and more than enough derision and contempt to go around added up to a problem extending well beyond her educational training. It would take determination, persistence, and, perhaps above all, a sense of humor to make a practical difference in the lives of these students<i>.</i></p><p><i>Inside Mrs. B's Classroom</i> is Baldacci's extraordinary memoir of life in the trenches of inner-city teaching. She takes us inside the classroom, and introduces us to a colorful cast of characters--both students and teachers alike. With wry wit and a sharp sense of irony, Baldacci relates her story with the grace and ease one needs to manage the days in a classroom such as hers. Developing strong (and absolutely essential) bonds with her fellow teachers proves to be her saving grace, but surprisingly, her students become her greatest inspiration. "Leaving school to walk home after gunfire had spit bullets through the neighborhood . . . they were my role models. As long as they kept coming to school, so would I," she says.</p><p><i>Inside Mrs. B's Classroom</i> is gritty and realistic, yet refreshingly funny and positive. Baldacci's dual career makes for an entertaining, informative tale, which weaves together her teacher's knowledge of the system and reporter's eye for detail. We're treated to an inspiring story of success, and come away with the conviction that one person <i>can</i> make a difference.</p><p>An Inside Look at the Daily Grind in Chicago's Inner-City Schools</p><p><i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> reporter Leslie Baldacci gave up her lucrative career to teach in her city's decaying public school system, certain that she'd be able to conquer this challenging new world. As she later commented, "I thought I knew rough. I thought I had answers. I didn't know jack."</p><p>But despite the difficulties she faced, including overpopulated classrooms, little to no faculty support, and a demanding workload that pushed her to her limit, Baldacci dove into her work, persevered, and eventually triumphed. She learned to catch the imagination and enthusiasm of students--and got to know these children better--children who often faced incredible challenges outside the school walls.</p><p>Along the way she used her journalistic eye to observe and analyze the workings of the Chicago Public School system from the front lines. The result is an informed, insightful work that takes into account both the very human element of the children and their teachers--as well as the red tape that surround them. She shares the unrealistic expectations, the surprises, and the individuals who make up education today. And above all, she shows how one dedicated person can make a difference.</p></p><h2>The Farewell of the Word: The Johannine Call to Abide</h2><p>Hardcover with dust jacket. VG/VG.

But what of his father, Philip II, who united Macedonia, created the best army in the world at the time, and conquered and annexed Greece? This landmark biography is the first to bring Philip to life, exploring the details of his life and legacy and demonstrating that his achievements were so remarkable that it can be argued they outshone&nbsp;those of his more famous son. Without Philip, Greek history would have been entirely different.</p><p>Taking into account recent archaeological discoveries and reinterpreting ancient literary records, Ian Worthington brings to light Philip&#x2019;s political, economic, military, social, and cultural accomplishments. He reveals the full repertoire of the king&#x2019;s tactics, including several polygamous diplomatic marriages, deceit, bribery, military force, and a knack for playing off enemies against one another. The author also inquires into the king&#x2019;s influences, motives, and aims, and in particular his turbulent, unraveling relationship with Alexander, which may have ended in murder. Philip became in many ways the first modern regent of the ancient world, and this book places him where he properly belongs: firmly at the center stage of Greek history.</p></p><p><b>Ian Worthington</b> is Frederick A.

The authoritative and clearly laid out text, fascinating maps, and up-to-the-minute facts, will help children acquire essential geographical knowledge and expand their understanding of how people live in many different parts of the world. </p><p>With its country-by-country layout, a glossary, index and a reference section at the back of the book, this new encyclopedia is an exciting reference book for the whole family.</p></p><p><p>Clive Gifford is an award-winning author of more than fifty books on the subjects of sports and soccer. His previous titles for Kingfisher include The Kingfisher Soccer Encyclopedia, Soccer Skills, Summer Olympics, and Soccer.</p>This book is directed to students in grades four through eight. Its most exciting feature is the superior illustrations, which take up about 50 percent of the page space. Chapter 1, "The Physical Earth," "describes how the planet was formed and then shaped by the forces of nature, by water and ice, by wind and volcanoes." It also explores how people's lives are influenced by climate and geography. Photos, charts, maps, and graphs are used to explain mountains, rivers, atmosphere, and more. Other articles cover the human impact on the earth. <p>In the main body of the encyclopedia, the world is divided by continent and subdivided by country. Helpful subdivisions are provided as needed. For example, the general U.S. section is followed by articles on the Eastern U.S., the Midwest and the Great Lakes, the South, the Western U.S., and Alaska and Hawaii. Articles vary from half a page (Bermuda, Gabon) to five (Germany) or six pages (India).</p><p>Each entry for a country includes text about its geography, industries and products, people, history and government, and what makes it unique or interesting. Each also has a picture of its flag, a physical map, a map locating it in the region, captioned photographs, and a summary of facts on area, population, capital city and its population, main languages, main religions, currency, main exports, and type of government. The book ends with a ready-reference section in which world maps and charts explore topics such as biomes, winds and ocean currents, time zones, religions, and communications.</p><p>This appealing book promises to spark the interest of users. Unfortunately, there is no key to the colors used in the physical maps of the countries (one can make a good guess), nor are there any sources or dates for statistics that are used. They are characterized only as "up-to-the-minute." Nevertheless, the book is recommended for school and public libraries needing a convenient, up-to-date geography encyclopedia for children. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ryckman&#39;s personal writing style presents the major theories in a straightforward way helping readers more easily distinguish between them. At the beginning of the text, Ryckman provides a framework that defines personality, and emphasizes the science of personality (including the interrelation between research and theory). Then, he introduces each major theoretical position with an objective overview of the theorist&#39;s basic concepts and principles. Ryckman concludes by noting the ways in which the different theories stimulate additional research efforts, and by presenting five current research trends that have resulted from the work of these earlier theorists. The result is a text that merges the best of classic and contemporary research in the field leaving students with a solid working knowledge of personality.</p><p>Richard M.

It reflects the insights and advances of two decades of counseling research and clinical experience, including updated clinical examples and new information on ethics, diagnosis, treatment, and psychopharmacology. Its revised philosophical perspectives underlie counseling initiatives in the twenty-first century. <i>The Counseling Experience,</i> 2/E, is a text that students, counselor educators, and clients will find useful and illuminating. It is not only an invaluable guide as students learn to translate counseling theory into effective clinical practice, but also an indispensable reference as they become seasoned mental health practitioners.<p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Kerr, <i>Becoming a Therapist: A Workbook for Personal Exploration</i> (ISBN 9781577661313); Levitov-Fall, <i>Translating Theory Into Practice: A Student Guide to Counseling Practicum and Internship</i> (ISBN 9781577665601); Martin, <i>Counseling and Therapy Skills,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN: 9781478628750); and Todd-Bohart, <i>Foundations of Clinical and Counseling Psychology,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781577664109).</p></p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Caplan-Caplan, Mental Health Consultation and Collaboration (ISBN 9781577660736); Levitov-Fall, Translating Theory Into Practice: A Student Guide to Counseling Practicum and Internship (ISBN 9781577665601); Martin, Counseling and Therapy Skills, Third Edition (ISBN 9781577666424); Martin-Moore, Basics of Clinical Practice: A Guidebook for Trainees in the Helping Professions (ISBN 9781577660057); and Todd-Bohart, Foundations of Clinical and Counseling Psychology, Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781577664109).</p><h2>The psychologist As Detective: An Introduction to Conducting Research in Psychology</h2><p><p><b></b>&nbsp;<i>The Psychologist as Detective</i>&nbsp;conveys the excitement of research methodology through a lively, conversational style. To make the study of the research process interactive and accessible for readers, pedagogical features and critical thinking activities are integrated throughout the volume. Actual student research appears in each chapter to increase relevance and heighten reader interest. </p> <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b> </b>This&nbsp;text evaluates the science of psychology, research ideas and hypotheses, ethics, nonexperimental methods and the basics of experimentation variables and control, statistics, designing-conducting-analyzing and interpreting experiments, as well as alternative research designs, external validity, critiquing experimental research and writing and assemblling an APA-format research report.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p><b> </b>For individuals involved with or interested in psychological research.</p><p>Preface Note to the Instructor <p> Margery Franklin (1990) quotes former Clark University professor and chair Heinz Werner's views on psychological research. Werner indicated: </p><p> I got rather apprehensive at finding that students were frequently<br> taught that there was only one acceptable way of conduct in the<br> laboratory&#x2014;there has to be an hypothesis set up, or a set of hypotheses,<br> and the main job of the experimenter is to prove or disprove the hypothesis.<br> What is missed here is the function of the scientist as a discoverer and<br>explorer of unknown lands ....Hypotheses...are essential elements of inquiry,<br> but they are so, not as rigid propositions but as flexible parts of the<br> process of searching; by the same token, conclusions drawn from the results<br> are as much an end as a beginning ....Now...academic psychologists<br> are beginning to see research not as a rigid exercise of rules of a game<br> but as a problem solving procedure, a probing into unknown lands with plans<br> which are not fixed but modifiable, with progress and retreat, with ranching<br> out into various directions or concentration on one.</p><p></p><p> Clearly Werner's views are as applicable in the 21st Century as they were during the heyday of behaviorism; they reflect perfectly the intent of this text. </p><p> From our vantage point, research in psychology is like a detective case; hence, the title we have chosen, The Psychologist as Detective. A problem presents itself, clues are discovered, bits of evidence that compete for our attention must be evaluated and accepted or discarded, and, finally, a report or summary of the case (research) is prepared for consideration by our peers. </p><p> When presented in this light, the research process in psychology will, we believe, be an interesting and stimulating endeavor for students. In short, our goal is to attract students to psychological research because of its inherent interest. </p><p> To accomplish this goal several pedagogical features have been employed in this text: </p><p> 1. To provide a sense of relevance and continuity, the theme of "psychologist as detective" runs throughout the text. </p><p> 2. Interactive Style of Writing. Based on the belief that the experimental psychology&#x2014;research methods text should be lively and engaging, we employ an interactive, conversational style of writing that we hope will help draw students into the material being presented. </p><p> 3. The Psychological Detective Feature. The questions or situations posed by these sections that appear throughout each chapter will encourage students to engage in critical thinking exercises. These sections also serve as excellent stimulants for productive class discussions. </p><p> 4. Marginal Definitions. Key definitions appear in the margin, close to the introduction of the term in the text. </p><p> 5. Review Summaries. To help students master smaller chunks of material, each chapter contains several review summaries. </p><p> 6. Study Breaks. Each Review Summary is followed by a Study Break that students can use to test their mastery of the material they have just completed. These study breaks should be especially helpful to your students when they prepare for quizzes and examinations. </p><p> We hope that these special features will provide your students with a positive experience as they learn the fundamentals of research methodology in psychology. Note to the Student </p><p> Welcome to the world of psychological research! Because the two of us have taught this course for over fifty years (combined!), we have seen the excitement that research can generate in student after student. As you will learn, conducting psychological research is very much like being a detective on a case. </p><p> Throughout this text we have tried to make it perfectly clear that research is something that you can (and should) become involved in. We hope you will enjoy reading about the student projects that we use as research examples throughout this text. Student research projects are making valuable contributions to our field. We hope to see your name among those making such contributions! </p><p> At this point we encourage you to stop immediately to review the list of pedagogical features highlighted in the "Note to the Instructor"...Did you humor us by actually looking at that list? If not, please do so now. To make full use of this text, you need to become actively involved; these pedagogical features will help you. Active involvement means that you need to stop to think about The Psychological Detective sections immediately when you encounter them, refer to figures and tables when directed to do so, and complete the Study Breaks when they appear. Becoming actively involved in this course helps the material come alive; your grade and your future involvement in psychology will thank you.

In A Room of One's Own (1929), she examines the work of past women writers, and looks ahead to a time when<br>women's creativity will not be hampered by poverty, or by oppression. In Three Guineas (1938), however, Woolf argues that women's historical exclusion offers them the chance to form a political and cultural identity which could challenge the drive towards fascism and war.</p><p>Morag Shiach is a Lecturer in English at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London.'Together these ten volumes make an attractive and reasonably priced (the volumes vary between L3.99 and L4.99) working edition of Virginia Woolf's best-known writing.

This memoir of his service is a remarkable narrative, filled with the minutiae of the soldier's life and paced by a continual succession of battlefield anecdotes.<p>Three main stories emerge from Benson's account: his reconnaissance exploits, his experiences in battle, and his escape from prison. Though not yet eighteen years old when he left his home in Augusta, Georgia, to join the army, Benson was soon singled out for the abilities that would serve him well as a scout. Not only was he a crack shot, a natural leader, and a fierce Southern partisan, but he had a kind of restless energy and curiosity, loved to take risks, and was an instant and infallible judge of human nature. His recollections of scouting take readers within arm's reach of Union trenches and encampments. Benson recalls that while eavesdropping he never failed to be shocked by the Yankees' foul language; he had never heard that kind of talk in a Confederate camp!</p><p>Benson's descriptions of the many battles in which he fought--including Cold Harbor, The Seven Days, Manassas, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg--convey the desperation of a full frontal charge and the blind panic of a disorganized retreat. Yet in these accounts, Benson's own demeanor under fire is manifest in the coolly measured tone he employs.</p><p>A natural writer, Benson captures the dark absurdities of war in such descriptions as those of hardened veterans delighting in the new shoes and other equipment they found on corpse-littered battlefields. His clothing often torn by bullets, Benson was also badly bruised a number of times by spent rounds. At one point, in May 1863, he was wounded seriously enough in the leg to be hospitalized, but he returned to the field before full recuperation.</p><p>Benson was captured behind enemy lines in May 1864 while on a scouting mission for General Lee. Confined to Point Lookout Prison in Maryland, he escaped after only two days and swam the Potomac to get back into Virginia. Recaptured near Washington, D.C., he was briefly held in Old Capitol Prison, then sent to Elmira Prison in New York. There he joined a group of ten men who made the only successful tunnel escape in Elmira's history. After nearly six months in captivity or on the run, he rejoined his unit in Virginia. Even at Appomattox, Benson refused to surrender but stole off with his brother to North Carolina, where they planned to join General Johnston. Finding the roads choked with Union forces and surrendered Confederates, the brothers ultimately bore their unsurrendered rifles home to Augusta.</p><p>Berry Benson first wrote his memoirs for his family and friends. Completed in 1878, they drew on his--and partially on his brother's--wartime diaries, as well as on letters that both brothers had written to family members during the war. The memoirs were first published in book form in 1962 but have long been unavailable. This edition, with a new foreword by the noted Civil War historian Herman Hattaway, will introduce this compelling story to a new generation of readers.</p></p><p>Susan Williams Benson was a daughter-in-law of Berry Benson. Edward J. Cashin is Professor Emeritus of History and Director of the Center for the Study of Georgia History at Augusta State University. His many books include <i>Lachlan McGillivray, Indian Trader</i> (Georgia) and <i>Paternalism in a Southern City</i> (Georgia)."This book showers well-deserved attention on one of the South's truly noble sons. Benson, who served his homeland from Charleston to Appomattox, won even greater glory late in life when he championed the innocence of Jewish factory boss Leo M. Frank, convicted of murder in 1913 in Atlanta and subsequently lynched. Benson was a terrific character and this volume does him justice."--Steve Oney, author of <i>And the Dead Shall Rise</i><br><br>"Well-told and very captivating."--<i>Civil War Courier</i><br><br>"[Benson] knew how to tell an exciting story. . . . Unusually descriptive; his book contains a host of little details."--<i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i><br><br>"An outstanding memoir . . . Berry Benson's work is both truly personal, with its focus on such experiences as his capture, his life in Federal prisons, and his ultimate escape, and a fine narrative, for he tells story after remarkable story in a lively yet unromantic style. . . . Those who have not yet made his acquaintance will find him an intriguing figure and his book an engaging one."--<i>Civil War History</i><br><br>"Long recognized as one of the outstanding memoirs by a common soldier in the Army of Northern Virginia."--<i>Civil War News</i><br><br>"Well worth reading for any history buff."--<i>Augusta Magazine</i><br><br>"His highly illuminating story serves as a building block to the larger issues, such as the maturation of innocent youth into seasoned veteran in the span of a few short years."--<i>Florida Historical Quarterly</i><br><br>"Benson's straightforward narrative is clear, concise, and, given his amazing exploits, remarkably free of boasting. . . . Benson's experiences as a prisoner of war elevate his memoirs above other first-hand accounts of the Civil War.&#x201d;--<i>Southern Historian</i></p><h2>Social Development</h2><p><p><i>Social Development, Second Edition </i>offers students a fresh and unique set of perspectives on social development.

In a culture inundated with novels and magazines, has the Bible become a religious book that we open only when we need helpful thoughts, quick guides for holy living, and nuggets of wisdom? And how much are we missing when we don t read the Bible in its entirety?When we read Scripture in this way, we lose the biblical narrative--the Bible as a whole story of history, from creation to its end, and of the human story within that creation.Lesslie Newbigin, one of the most legendary theologians of the 20th century, uses simple storytelling to guide us through an accessible understanding and reorientation of the biblical narrative.Join Newbigin on a journey that goes from Genesis to Revelation, stopping to introduce the characters of Abraham, Moses, Noah, the prophets, Paul, and Jesus. This potent summary of the Bible is an undeniable need in the life of anyone seeking to interact with God more fully, through his story.</p><p>Lesslie Newbigin was a founding bishop of the Church of South India and associate general secretary of the World Council of Churches. He is the author of Proper Confidence: Faith, Doubt, and Certainty in Christian Discipleship, The Gospel in a Pluralist Society; and foolishness to the Greeks: Gospel and Western Culture.</p><h2>A Brief History of Everything (20th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p><b>A new edition of the best-selling work from one of the most forward-thinking and important philosophers of our time.</b><br><br>Join one of the greatest contemporary philosophers on a breathtaking tour of time and the Kosmos&#x2014;from the Big Bang right up to the eve of the twenty-first century. This accessible and entertaining summary of Ken Wilber&#x2019;s great ideas has been expanding minds now for two decades, providing a kind of unified field theory of the universe and, along the way, treating a host of issues related to that universe, from gender roles, to multiculturalism, to environmentalism, and even the meaning of the Internet. This special anniversary edition contains as an afterword a dialogue between the author and Lana Wachowski, the award-winning writer-director of the&nbsp;<i>Matrix</i>&nbsp;film trilogy, in which we&#x2019;re offered an intimate glimpse into the evolution of Ken&#x2019;s thinking and where he stands today.&nbsp;<i>A Brief History of Everything</i>&nbsp;may well be the best introduction to the thought of this man who has been called the &#x201c;Einstein of Consciousness&#x201d; (John White).</p><p>This account of men and women&#39;s place in a universe of sex and gender, self and society, spirit and soul is written in question-and-answer format, making it both readable and accessible. Wilber offers a series of original views on many topics of current controversy, including the gender wars, multiculturalism, modern liberation movements, and the conflict between various approaches to spirituality.Now available for the first time on compact disc, here is Ken Wilber�s expansive account of our place in a universe of sex, soul, and spirit. Told in an accessible and entertaining question-and-answer format, A Brief History of Everything examines the course of evolution as the unfolding manifestation of Spirit, from matter to life to mind, including the higher stages of spiritual development where Spirit becomes conscious of itself. Wilber offers striking and original views on many topics of continuing interest and controversy: gender relations, modern liberation movements, environmental ethics, and the conflict between this-worldly and other-worldly approaches to spirituality, and much more.

Shane Hamilton paints an eye-opening portrait of the rural highways of the American heartland, and in doing so explains why working-class populist voters are drawn to conservative politicians who seemingly don't represent their financial interests.</p><br><p> Hamilton challenges the popular notion of "red state" conservatism as a devil's bargain between culturally conservative rural workers and economically conservative demagogues in the Republican Party. The roots of rural conservatism, Hamilton demonstrates, took hold long before the culture wars and free-market fanaticism of the 1990s. As Hamilton shows, truckers helped build an economic order that brought low-priced consumer goods to a greater number of Americans. They piloted the big rigs that linked America's factory farms and agribusiness food processors to suburban supermarkets across the country.</p><br><br><p> <i>Trucking Country</i> is the gripping account of truckers whose support of post-New Deal free enterprise was so virulent that it sparked violent highway blockades in the 1970s. It's the story of "bandit" drivers who inspired country songwriters and Hollywood filmmakers to celebrate the "last American cowboy," and of ordinary blue-collar workers who helped make possible the deregulatory policies of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and set the stage for Wal-Mart to become America's most powerful corporation in today's low-price, low-wage economy.</p></p><p><p>"Move over Tom Frank.

Still a commissioned vessel, she lies today at Portsmouth, England, where thousands visit her each year. Many marvel at her beauty and wonderful state of preservation, the result of the extraordinary work lavished on her over the past two hundred years. A must for Nelson enthusiasts, historians, and preservationists, this book tells the story of the painstaking historical research and fine craftsmanship that restored the ship to its age-of-sail glory. The narrative of the restoration is accompanied by two hundred recently commissioned drawings that show the ship as it was in 1805 and a hundred paintings and photographs. In addition to the technical details of construction and fittings, the book describes the <i>Victory</i>'s fabled career and what life on board was like for the officers and crew.</p><p></p><h2>Ruth Duckworth: Modernist Sculptor</h2><p>In a career spanning more than six decades, Ruth Duckworth has created an immense and important body of work. Her ambition, intensity, and defiance of convention have governed her personal journey - fleeing from Nazi Germany to England at the outset of World War II, and settling in the United States in the mid-1960s - as well as her prodigious artistic output. Although Duckworth started out sculpting in stone, and has created both intimate and large-scale artworks in bronze and other materials, she has since the early 1960s predominantly worked in clay. It is for her work in this medium that she is recognized as one of the twentieth century's most innovative and significant sculptors. A true alchemist of abstraction, Duckworth has consistently produced barrier-bending art that is elegant yet at the same time buoyant, visionary works of seductive refinement, austere power, and radiant immediacy that masterfully continue the aesthetics of modernism into the twenty-first-century.<br>This volume, which accompanies a major touring exhibition provides a long-overdue assessment of Duckworth's significance. It reveals the conceptual and iconographic foundations that Duckworth's work shares with other important modernist sculptors.</p><p>Jo Lauria is an independent curator and art consultant, and former Decorative Arts Curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Madison</em> and <em>Scott v. Sandford</em> (the Dred Scott decision) to <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> and <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. <br> Here are the landmark decisions that have shaped American life, described by some of our most eminent legal scholars. Arranged alphabetically, each entry provides the <em>United States Reports</em> citation, the date the case was argued and decided, the vote of the Justices, who wrote the opinion for the Court, who concurred, and who dissented. More importantly, the entries feature an informative account of the particulars of the case, the legal and social background, the reasoning behind the Court's decision, and the case's impact on American society. Kermit Hall has drawn the material primarily from the acclaimed <em>Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court</em>, revising and updating entries where necessary, and he has written 47 new entries covering recent notable cases, including <em>Clinton v. Jones, Reno v. Shaw, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</em>, and <em>Turner</em> <em>Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC.</em> The <em>Guide</em> also features a case index (including all cases mentioned anywhere in the text), a topical index, the Constitution of the United States, an appendix on the Justices, and a legal glossary. <br> For anyone interested in the great controversies of our time, this invaluable book is a must read--a primer on the epic constitutional battles that have informed American life.</p><p>Kermit L. Hall, Dean of the College of Humanities, Executive Dean of the Colleges of the Arts and Sciences, and Professor of History and Law at Ohio State University, is well versed in American constitutional and legal history, and has a skillful touch when it comes to editing the contributions of well over 100 legal scholars (from attorneys and state supreme court justices to professors of law, political science, constitutional history, and government), producing a reference tome that invites the attention of lay legal beagles, students of American history, and practicing members of the legal profession.<p> The first 348 pages are devoted to an alphabetically arranged presentation of more than 400 of the Supreme Court's most significant and consequential decisions, from <i>Abington School District v. Schempp</i> (1963, reaffirming that the establishment clause forbids public schools from sponsoring religious prayerful practices) to <i>Zurcher v. "The Stanford Daily"</i> (1978, ruling 5 to 3 that the Palo Alto police had violated neither the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press nor the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches when they obtained a warrant and inspected the offices of Stanford University's student newspaper). Each case synopsis, generally half a page to a full page in length, describes the background incident, the constitutional issues in question, a concise summary of the reasoning behind the majority and dissenting opinions, what the public reaction was, and in what ways that ruling affected future cases and laws.</p><p> In addition, there's a glossary of terms, defining general legal concepts such as <i>bail</i> as well as less commonly known practices such as the Bad Tendency Test, an appendix containing the Constitution of the United States, another appendix covering the nominations and succession of Supreme Court justices, and an exhaustively comprehensive topical index. It's a pleasure to see a reference work that so effectively and engagingly treats the major decisions of the Supreme Court from 1789 to present. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><br><strong>Kermit L.

Illustrated with over 150 color and black-and-white pictures, chosen to illuminate and complement the text, this lively and readable work is an ideal introduction to philosophy for anyone interested in the history of ideas. From Plato's <em>Republic</em> and St. Augustine's <em>Confessions</em> through Marx's <em>Capital</em> and Sartre's <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, the extraordinary philosophical dialogue between great Western minds has flourished unabated through the ages. Dazzling in its genius and breadth, the long line of European and American intellectual discourse tells a remarkable story--a quest for truth and wisdom that continues to shape our most basic ideas about human nature and the world around us. That quest is brilliantly brought to life in <em>The Oxford History of Western Philosophy</em>.<br> With spectacular illustrations--including sixteen pages of full-color plates--this splendidly written volume takes the reader on a magnificent chronological tour through the revolutions of thought that have forged the Western philosophical tradition from ancient times to the present. Throughout, the six contributors--an internationally renowned team of philosophers including Roger Scruton, Anthony Quinton, and Anthony Kenny--bring the astonishingly diverse, wide-ranging landscape of intellectual history into sharp focus, emphasizing how notions seen today as part of an inevitable march of ideas were in their own time often considered radical, if not revolutionary. Thus we are treated, for example, to lively accounts of how Plato's "theory of forms" and Aristotle's pioneering exercises in logic broke with the past to irrevocably alter the course of Western thought. The authors also reveal the relationships between landmark thinkers, and the ways they drew on their intellectual heritage. They show, for instance, how St. Augustine and Aquinas, though advancing the cause of Christian doctrine, picked up where their pagan Greek forebears had left off. We witness how, during the Renaissance, the profound empiricist ideas underlying Descartes's famous utterance--"I think, therefore I exist"--lived in a tense but complementary relationship with Locke's rationalist theories. Moving into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the book explores how Hume greatly influenced Kant's conception of the "transcendental aesthetic," and how Hegel drew upon the lesser known (but groundbreaking) work of Fichte and Schelling. The authors bring the story up to our own time, vividly recounting the existential trend from Nietzsche ("God is dead") to Sartre, along with other increasingly fractious schools of thought. Along the way, we not only encounter the vast intellectual riches of the Western mind, but we also meet the personalities behind the great thoughts, from the saintly Hume (described by Adam Smith as having "come as near to perfection as anybody could") to the ill-mannered outcast Fichte. And the hundreds of maps and striking illustrations (including full-color reproductions of art ranging from medieval manuscripts to the works of Raphael, Ingres, and Magritte) form an integral part of the book, revealing the interweaving of art and ideas through the ages, as artists have striven to give visual immediacy to philosophical concepts.<br> <em>The Oxford History of Western Philosophy</em> is the most authoritative single-volume account ever written for the general reader. Engagingly written and astonishingly far-reaching, it provides the consummate introduction to the intellectual bedrock upon which Western civilization is built.</p><p>What does philosophy look like? Can you take a picture of it? <i>The Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy</i> may not answer these questions, but it manages to ask them artfully with just a hint of schizophrenia. Sometimes it is a concise but substantive account of the history of Western philosophy; other times it is a coffee-table book that lends itself to casual thumbing-through. Pause long enough to wonder at Kant's silhouette, Jeremy Bentham's infamous Panopticon, a photo of Machiavelli's writing desk, or the Ephesian wall painting of Socrates. The volume lives up to its name: there are over two dozen full-color pictures--such as Paul Gauguin's arresting painting <i>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</i>--and myriad black-and-white illustrations of all varieties. <p> Editor Anthony Kenny parses his history into just six chunks of philosophy--ancient, medieval, three flavors of modern, and political--but amazingly the book does not seem to skimp on details.

Emerson</strong> is a former U.S. Army officer and program manager for various defense engineering firms. A recognized specialist on army material culture, Emerson is the author of <em>Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms</em>, also published by the University of Oklahoma Press.</p>Emerson, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, is the author of <i>Chevrons</i>, a detailed book on U.S. Army insignia, and a member of many collectors organizations. This massive reference book is intended for researchers, historians, collectors, dealers, and curators. It covers insignia and uniforms of the U.S. Army from 1782 to the present. Before insignia became common, the design of the uniform was especially important in identifying nationality and branch of service. Thus, one-third of this book is devoted to the study of uniforms, and two-thirds covers insignia. The book is divided into 22 sections and 80 chapters that are arranged to allow the identification of like objects (e.g., section 8, <i>Musician's Insignias</i>; chapter 13, "Lyres"; chapter 14, "Bugles, Horns, and Trumpets"). Coverage includes all branches of the army and everything from field clothing to dress uniforms. Insignia and uniforms for chaplins, medical personnel, foreign units, Indians, and women are covered in detail. The text is profusely illustrated with more than 2,000 black-and-white photographs and occasional line drawings. The illustrations are appropriately placed throughout the text and frequently show the items being worn. In an appendix is a well-illustrated seven-page essay on insignia fasteners. The bibliography has 249 listings for books, government documents, periodicals, and catalogs. Also assisting users is a nine-page index with appropriate <i>see</i> and <i>see also</i> references. Italic designations for illustrations in the index are hard to distinguish from regular type.<p>The only comparable work is the much smaller <i>Military Dress of North America, 1665^-1970</i> by Windro (Scribner, 1973). It contains approximately 100 color and line drawings and 100 black-and-white photographs. Approximately one-third of that book is devoted to coverage of pre-Revolutionary armies in North America. Except for this small time period, Emerson is far more extensive in coverage and detail. Academic, public, and special libraries will want to consider this excellent book for their collections. <i></i></p></p><h2>Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation</h2><p>A highly accessible introduction to LISP, this is for inexperienced programmers and programmers new to LISP.

Yet even now the art and life of this controversial and extremely influential German artist remain impenetrably intertwined - even more so perhaps because Beuys, like Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol, precisely orchestrated his public image, building a personal myth that has the power to bind together his entire oeuvre.<br>Thinking Is Form breaks through the mass of obscure writing about Joseph Beuys to introduce this legendary artist in a simple and clear manner, through his utterly individual drawings. The subject of a major touring exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and The Art Institute of Chicago, Beuys's drawings are used here as the springboard for discussions of his life, art, and ideas. Some employ such unconventional mediums as hare's blood or margarine, or use the backs of envelopes or commercial stationery. Some incorporate photographs, pressed flowers, and other organic materials, emphasizing their function as a reservoir of ideas for Beuys's sculpture, actions (performance art), and other enterprises.<br>His achievement is viewed in the broader context of European art, and his graphic works are considered chronologically as his formative medium, in relation to his work as a whole, and as autobiographical narrative. This is the first time that the disciplines of curator and connoisseur have been rigorously applied to the selection and presentation of a truly representative segment of Beuys's work.<br>Beuys, following the strategy articulated by Duchamp, made his own life his masterwork, and his drawings formed the drafts for that work. Now that the work is complete, it is through the drawings that we can begin to grasp as a whole the accomplishment of a man who declared "Everyone is an artist."</p><p></p><h2>Collective Bargaining: How It Works and Why: A Manual of Theory and Practice</h2><p>Book by Thomas R.

Wilhelmsen&#x2019;s <em>Being and Knowing</em>, rooted in the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, rests on two basic assertions: first, metaphysics is the science of being in its first and ultimate act, existence (the act by which all things manifest themselves); second, that existence is known not through observing objects, but in affirming through judgments that these objects are subjects of existence.</p> <p>The chapters of this book explore these Thomistic doctrines. Some explain St. Thomas Aquinas&#x2019;s philosophy of being. Others probe his epistemology. The complexity and density of Aquinas&#x2019;s theory of judgment (that truth is realized in the judgment of man), emphasized throughout most of the book, point not only to a deeper understanding of the nature of metaphysics, but they open doors to the clarification of philosophical issues germane to contemporary thought.</p> <p>This work addresses a number of metaphysical philosophical paradoxes.

Since then <i>Flatland</i> has fascinated generations of readers, becoming a perennial science-fiction favorite. By imagining the contact of beings from different dimensions, the author fully exploited the power of the analogy between the limitations of humans and those of his two-dimensional characters.</p><br><p> A first-rate fictional guide to the concept of multiple dimensions of space, the book will also appeal to those who are interested in computer graphics. This field, which literally makes higher dimensions seeable, has aroused a new interest in visualization. We can now manipulate objects in four dimensions and observe their three-dimensional slices tumbling on the computer screen. But how do we interpret these images? In his introduction, Thomas Banchoff points out that there is no better way to begin exploring the problem of understanding higher-dimensional slicing phenomena than reading this classic novel of the Victorian era.</p></p><p><i>Flatland</i> is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England.<p> <em>Flatland</em> (1884) is an influential mathematical fantasy that simultaneously provides an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and a satire on the Victorian class structure, issues of science and faith, and the role of women. A classic of early science fiction, the novel takes place in a world of two dimensions where all the characters are geometric shapes. The narrator, A Square, is a na�ve, respectable citizen who is faced with proof of the existence of three dimensions when he is visited by a sphere and is forced to see the limitations of his world. </p> <p> The introduction to this Broadview Edition provides context for the book&#x2019;s references to Victorian culture and religion, mathematical history, and the history of philosophy. The appendices contain contemporary reviews; extracts from the work of fellow mathematical fantasy writer/mathematician Charles Hinton; Hermann von Helmboltz&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Axioms of Geometry&#x201d; (1870); and autobiographical passages from Abbott&#x2019;s <em>The Kernel and the Husk</em> (1886). </p></p><h2>Sweet Thursday (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br>In Monterey, on the California coast, Sweet Thursday is what they call the day after Lousy Wednesday, which is one of those days that are just naturally bad.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B.

Fascinating and engaging, the book illustrates how science works, and how scientists depend on evidence to test hypotheses. Students will learn to focus on the scientific method through the strong central theme of &#34;how we know what we know.&#34; Through a discussion of this interplay between evidence and hypothesis, Seeds provides not just a series of facts, but also a conceptual framework for understanding the logic of astronomical knowledge. The book vividly conveys the author&#39;s love of astronomy, shows students how the universe can be described by a small set of physical laws, and illustrates how they can comprehend their place in the universe by understanding these laws, rather than simply memorizing facts. By crafting a story about astronomy, Seeds shows students how to ask questions of nature and therefore gradually puzzle out the beautiful secrets of the physical world. The book&#39;s use of mathematics is incorporated into the body of the text (as well as in separate sections for easy reference), but the arguments of the text do not depend on mathematical reasoning, allowing math-averse students to easily follow the story. The revision covers the history of astronomy, elementary physics concepts, stars and galaxies, the origins of the universe, and the solar system.</p><p>Michael A. Seeds has been Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, since 1970.

Today, ideas of our prehistoric origins are more likely based on ocean core samples, radio-carbon dating, and archeological artifacts. But as Barry Cunliffe reminds us in <em>Britain Begins</em>, an archaeologist writing of the past must be constantly aware that the past is, in truth, unknowable. Like the myth-making Celts, we too create stories about our origins, based on what we know today. <br><br>Cunliffe here offers readers a vision of both worlds, looking at new myths and old, as he tells the fascinating story of the origins of the British and the Irish, from around 10,000 BC to the eve of the Norman Conquest. Using the most up-to-date archaeological evidence together with new work on DNA and other scientific techniques which help us to trace the origins and movements of these early settlers, Cunliffe offers a rich narrative account of the first islanders--who they were, where they came from, and how they interacted with one another. Underlying this narrative is the story of the sea, and Cunliffe paints a fascinating picture of early ships and sails and of the surprising sophistication of early navigation. The story told by the archaeological evidence is enhanced by historical texts, such as Julius Caesar's well-known if rather murky vision of Britain. Equally interesting, Cunliffe looks at the ideas of Britain's origins formed by our long-ago ancestors themselves, when they used what scraps there were, gleaned from Biblical and classical texts, to create a largely mythological origin for the British.</p><p><br><strong>Barry Cunliffe</strong> is Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford.

I highly recommend you buy the second edition!</b><br><br><i>Explaining Creativity is an accessible introduction to the latest scientific research on creativity. In the last 50 yearss, psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists have increasingly studied creativity, and we now know more about creativity that at any point in history. <em>Explaining</em> <em>Creativity</em> considers not only arts like painting and writing, but also science, stage performance, and business innovation. Until about a decade ago, creativity researchers tended to focus on highly valued activities like fine art painting and Nobel prize winning science. Sawyer brings this research up to date by including movies, music videos, cartoons, videogames, hypertext fiction, and computer technology. For example, this is the first book on creativity to include studies of performance and improvisation. Sawyer draws on the latest research findings to show the importance of collaboration and context in all of these creative activities.<br><br>Today's science of creativity is interdisciplinary; in addition to psychological studies of creativity, <em>Explaining Creativity</em> includes research by anthropologists on creativity in non-Western cultures, and research by sociologists about the situations, contexts, and networks of creative activity. <em>Explaining Creativity</em> brings these approaches together within the <em>sociocultural</em></i><em> approach to creativity pioneered by Howard Becker, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Howard Gardner. The sociocultural approach moves beyond the individual to consider the social and cultural contexts of creativity, emphasizing the role of collaboration and context in the creative process.</em></p><p><br><strong>R. Keith Sawyer</strong> is Associate Professor of Education at Washington University. He is the author of many books on creativity, including <em>Improvised Dialogues</em>, <em>Creating Conversations</em>, and <em>Group Creativity</em>.<br><br>"Sawyer has put together a mountain of research from a variety of fields to create a unified approach to understanding how people manage to do something different. His book is readable and learned, origninal, but mindful of its relation to all that other work, and well worth the attention of anyone who wants to think seriously about innovation in the arts and in social organizations."--Howard S. Becker, author of <em>Art World</em>, <em>Tricks of the Trade</em> and <em>Outsiders</em><p></p><br>"An extremely knowledgable, wide-ranging, integrative summary of how the social sciences understand creativity. Keith Sawyer has again produced an intelligent and valuable contribution to knowledge.

Davidson, Professor, Peter F. Drucker School of Management, Claremont Graduate University<p></p><br>"With the publication of <em>Explaining Creativity</em>, Keith Sawyer has emerged as the leading young scholar and proponent of a sociocultural approach to the study of creativity. And with his remarkable grasp of this young field, Professor Sawyer has written the most comprehensive and compelling work on creativity studies in years."--David Henry Feldman, Professor, Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development, Tufts University, and co-author of <em>Changing the World</em><p></p><br>"Without doubt <em>Explaining Creativity</em> is the most comprehensive single-volume presentation of what we know about the creative process, person, and product. Besides that, the book is extremely well written. It would be my first recommendation for anyone fascinated with creativity in all of its complexities and manifestations. There's simply nothing better out there for either specialist or general reader."--Dean Keith Simonton, Distinguished Professor, Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, and author of <em>Origins of Genius</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Financial &amp; Managerial Accounting</h2><p><strong>NOTE:Item is a standalone book and DOES NOT incldue access code.</strong><br><br>Market-leading Warren/Reeve/Duchac's FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING has been on the forefront of innovation and change based on the needs of today's teaching and learning environment.

Pettis combines the insights of economic history, economic theory, and finance theory into a comprehensive model for understanding sovereign liability management and the causes of financial crises. He examines recent financial crises in emerging market countries along with the history of international lending since the 1820s to argue that the process of international lending is driven primarily by external events and not by local politics and/or economic policies. He draws out the corporate finance implications of this approach to argue that most of the current analyses of the recent financial crises suffered by Latin America, Asia, and Russia have largely missed the point. He then develops a sovereign finance model, analogous to corporate finance, to understand the capital structure needs of emerging market countries. Using this model, he finally puts into perspective the recent crises, a new sovereign liability management theory, the implications of the model for sovereign debt restructurings, and the new financial architecture.<br><br> Bridging the gap between finance specialists and traders, on the one hand, and economists and policy-makers on the other, <em>The Volatility Machine</em> is critical reading for anyone interested in where the international economy is going over the next several years.<br></p><p>"Michael Pettis brilliantly demystifies the complexities of global finance, banking and capital markets crisis.

But as Martha Biondi shows, a grassroots struggle for racial equality in the urban North began a full ten years before the rise of the movement in the South. This story is an essential first chapter, not only to the southern movement that followed, but to the riots that erupted in northern and western cities just as the civil rights movement was achieving major victories. </p><p>Biondi tells the story of African Americans who mobilized to make the war against fascism a launching pad for a postwar struggle against white supremacy at home. Rather than seeking integration in the abstract, black New Yorkers demanded first-class citizenship--jobs for all, affordable housing, protection from police violence, access to higher education, and political representation. This powerful local push for economic and political equality met broad resistance, yet managed to win several landmark laws barring discrimination and segregation. </p><p><i>To Stand and Fight</i> demonstrates how black New Yorkers launched the modern civil rights struggle and left a rich legacy.</p></p><p>Martha Biondi is Associate Professor of African-American Studies and History at Northwestern University.&#x201c;With stunning research and powerful arguments, Martha Biondi charts a new direction in civil rights history - the northern side of the black freedom struggle. Biondi presents postwar New York as a battleground, no less than the Jim Crow South, for the fight against police brutality and discrimination in employment, housing, retail stores, and places of amusement. Men and women, trade unionists and religious leaders, integrationists and separatists, liberals and the Left come together in this pathbreaking study of America's largest and most cosmopolitan city.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, editor-in-chief of <i>The Harvard Guide to African-American History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>To Stand and Fight</i> brilliantly re-writes the history of postwar social movements in New York City. Martha Biondi has not only extended our view of the civil rights movement to the urban North, but she places the movement squarely within an international framework. She redefines the movement, focusing on the specific struggles that mattered: jobs, welfare, housing, police misconduct, political representation, and black people's ongoing battle for independence in the colonies. <i>To Stand and Fight</i> will stand out as a major contribution to an already burgeoning field of civil rights studies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical<br>Imagination</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>To Stand and Fight</i> establishes that New York was as important a battleground for racial equality as Montgomery or Birmingham. Martha Biondi has done a great service by uncovering the rich and largely forgotten history of New York's role in the African American freedom struggle.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas J. Sugrue, author of <i>The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Historians have thoroughly documented the experiences of those African Americans who lived in the South and worked to repeal Jim Crow laws. However, in this work, Biondi explores what she calls 'the struggle for Negro rights' in New York City, an exploration resulting in a stark reminder of the daily challenges facing blacks who lived in northern cities...With its detailed discussions of the American Labor Party, the Communist Party, Black Nationalism, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., W. E. B. Dubois, Roy Wilkins, and, especially, Paul Robeson, this work should be required reading for all historians interested in the post-WW II experience of African Americans in the urban North.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>T. D. Beal</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this meticulously researched monograph, Biondi reminds the reader that the struggle for black civil rights was waged in the North before it was joined in the South. She documents the fight against racial discrimination in hiring, police brutality, housing segregation, lack of political representation, and inadequate schools in New York City between 1946 and 1954...Biondi's writing is crisp and direct. She introduces the reader to a host of activists whose efforts deserve to be remembered. Unfortunately, most of the causes they championed remain with us today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul T. Murray</b><b>, </b><b><i>MultiCultural Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;By examining the fight for equality in New York...Biondi...contribute[s] further to our understanding of race in America, in general, and the nature and course of the civil rights movement, more specifically.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter B. Levy</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of American Ethnic History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Martha Biondi...has written a scathing critique of the polities of anti-Communism&#x2015;not just its often-paranoid fantasies and rights violations. Biondi powerfully argues that the damaging legacy of anti-Communism lies in the ways it crippled a vision for a more just and equal New York City, and, by extension, the nation by destroying the careers of many of its most visionary citizens. Biondi&#x2019;s <i>To Stand and Fight: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Postwar New York</i> joins an emerging body of scholarship that overturns the Southern focus of Civil Rights history. Biondi takes us to New York&#x2015;the home of the largest black community in the nation and, like its more notorious Southern counterparts, segregated in housing, schools, and most public and private accommodations. Biondi powerfully unravels hard and fast distinctions between Northern and Southern racism. Through an examination of numerous incidences of police brutality against African Americans in postwar NYC, the chapter on Northern lynching is a stark reminder of the state-sanctioned violence that ensured Northern segregation and inequality.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeanne Theoharis</b><b>, </b><b><i>Left History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Biondi's book makes the counterintuitive point that the modern civil rights movement began in the north, not in the south. It did not begin with the Montgomery bus boycott; it did not begin with the Supreme Court desegregation decision of 1954. In the aftermath of World War II, the civil rights movement came alive in northern cities. She focuses on New York City. Biondi highlights the moment when racial egalitarianism became a core element of modern liberalism. It wasn't before. In the 1930s Roosevelt worked closely with racist, segregationist Southern Democrats who controlled important committees. He needed them to get measures through Congress. In other words, you could be a good New Deal liberal and be a total racist. Many liberals were racial egalitarians but many liberals were racists. Views on race were not part of the definition of liberalism. Today you can't be a racist and a liberal.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Foner</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Browser</i></b></p><h2>Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)</h2><p>Demonstrates how nonresponse in sample surveys and censuses can be handled by replacing each missing value with two or more multiple imputations.

In these essays, which have appeared over the course of the last three decades, he argues that Western scholars and policymakers have almost invariably underrated the influence of ethnonationalism and misinterpreted its passionate and nonrational qualities. Several of the essays have become classics: together they represent a rigorous and stimulating attempt to establish a secure methodological foundation for the study of a complicated phenomenon increasingly, if belatedly, recognized as the major cause of global political instability.</p><br><p> The book opens by reviewing a wide range of scholarship on ethnonationalism. Connor examines nineteenth-and early twentieth-century debate among British scholars on the viability and desirability of the multinational state, the American "nation-building" school of thought that dominated the literature on political development in the post-World War II era, and the recent explosion of literature on ethnonationalism. In the second part of the book, he shows how progress in the study of ethnonationalism has been hampered by terminological confusion, an inclination to perceive homogeneity even where heterogeneity thrives, an unwarranted tendency to seek explanation for ethnic conflict in economic differentials, and lack of historical perspective. The book closes with a consideration of the inherent limitations of rational inquiry into the realm of group-identity.</p></p><p><p>"More than anyone else, Walker Connor invented the term 'ethnonationalism.' In these essays he explains why the phenomenom has been misunderstood by scholars from all ends of the ideological spectrum. . . . His predictions, dating from the 1960s, that nationalism would outlive socialism in the Marxist-Leninist states have been totally vindicated by events in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and much of the rest of the world."--<b>John Stone, European University Institute and George Mason University</b></p><b>Walker Connor</b> is the John R.

Kennedy on May 25, 1961, initiating the expedition to the moon, is now documented in full for future students of history. To John Logsdon, whose approach is that of a political scientist examining the influence of men and events on the decision-making process, the decision to land a man on the moon "before this decade is out" was wholly political rather than military, although overtones of implied defense were useful in obtaining congressional support. Moreover, he notes it was made without the support of the scientific community, although their previous research efforts were expected partially to offset this deterrent.<br> <br> Although the success of the Russian manned orbit and the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs invasion certainly influenced the timing, in the author's interpretation the Kennedy decision manages to escape the narrow definition of a public relations exhibition. In Kennedy's view, he emphasizes, the security of the country itself was inseparably linked to a position of prestige in world opinion. Nor was he a particular enthusiast of space exploration for its own rewards. As he remarked to one of his advisors, "If you had a scientific spectacular on this earth that would be more useful&#x2014;say desalting the ocean&#x2014;or something just as dramatic and convincing as space, then we would do <i>that."</i><br> <br> The thoroughness of this book as a historical record is evident throughout. NASA historical records and government documents not previously released, including several Presidential papers, are used in the analysis, and the author weaves these records together with subtleties of opinion from interviews with NASA officials and such Kennedy advisors as Theodore Sorenson, McGeorge Bundy, David Bell, and Jerome Wiesner.</p><p></p><h2>Essential Elements of Public Speaking, The (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p>This brief, skills-focused, and highly interactive presentation of public speaking emphasizes the newest research methods and critical listening and thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Essential Elements of Public Speaking</i> is a concise exploration of the ins and outs of public speaking and makes a clear link between theory and practice&#x2013;all in only twelve chapters.</p></p><p></p><h2>Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome</h2><p>For decades after the identification of the structure of DNA, scientists focused only on genes, the regions of the genome that contain codes for the production of proteins. Other regions that make up 98 percent of the human genome were dismissed as "junk," sequences that serve no purpose. But researchers have recently discovered variations and modulations in this junk DNA that are involved with a number of intractable diseases. Our increasing knowledge of junk DNA has led to innovative research and treatment approaches that may finally ameliorate some of these conditions.<br><br>Junk DNA can play vital and unanticipated roles in the control of gene expression, from fine-tuning individual genes to switching off entire chromosomes. These functions have forced scientists to revisit the very meaning of the word "gene" and have engendered a spirited scientific battle over whether or not this genomic "nonsense" is the source of human biological complexity. Drawing on her experience with leading scientific investigators in Europe and North America, Nessa Carey provides a clear and compelling introduction to junk DNA and its critical involvement in phenomena as diverse as genetic diseases, viral infections, sex determination in mammals, and evolution. We are only now unlocking the secrets of junk DNA, and Nessa Carey's book is an essential resource for navigating the history and controversies of this fast-growing, hotly disputed field.</p><p>Nessa Carey is a visiting professor at Imperial College, London.

This work, known primarily for its erotic realism, is also a landmark in the development of narrative art--not only from a specifically Chinese perspective but also in a world-historical context.</p><br><p> Written during the second half of the sixteenth century and first published in 1618, <i>The Plum in the Golden Vase</i> is noted for its surprisingly modern technique. With the possible exception of <i>The Tale of Genji</i> (ca. 1010) and <i>Don Quixote</i> (1605, 1615), there is no earlier work of prose fiction of equal sophistication in world literature. Although its importance in the history of Chinese narrative has long been recognized, the technical virtuosity of the author, which is more reminiscent of the Dickens of <i>Bleak House</i>, the Joyce of <i>Ulysses</i>, or the Nabokov of <i>Lolita</i> than anything in earlier Chinese fiction, has not yet received adequate recognition. This is partly because all of the existing European translations are either abridged or based on an inferior recension of the text. This translation and its annotation aim to faithfully represent and elucidate all the rhetorical features of the original in its most authentic form and thereby enable the Western reader to appreciate this Chinese masterpiece at its true worth.</p><br><p> Replete with convincing portrayals of the darker side of human nature, it should appeal to anyone interested in a compelling story, compellingly told.</p></p><p><p>"Generations of readers will be grateful for Roy's monumental translation of the Chin P'ing Mei.

In the case of France, scholars sharply disagree, not only over the nature of French national identity but also over the extent to which diverse and sometimes hostile provincial communities became integrated into the nation. In <i>When Champagne Became French: Wine and the Making of a National Identity,</i> Kolleen M.

Drawing on concepts from social and cultural history, she shows how champagne helped fuel the revolution in consumption as social groups searched for new ways to develop cohesion and to establish status. By the end of the nineteenth century, Guy concludes, the champagne-producing provinces in the department of Marne had developed a rhetoric of French identity that promoted its own marketing success as national. This ability to mask local interests as national concerns convinced government officials of the need, at both national and international levels, to protect champagne as a French patrimony. </p></p><p><p><b>Kolleen M.

Readers discover a rule that once licensed the slave trade and apartheid and genocide, a rule whose abolition has marked some of humanity's greatest triumphs-yet a rule that still enflames tyranny and war and terrorism through today's multi-trillion dollar resource trade.<br><br>BLOOD OIL shows how the West can now lead a peaceful revolution by ending its dependence on authoritarian oil, and by getting shoppers out of business with the men of blood. The book describes practical strategies for upgrading world trade: for choosing new rules that will make us more secure at home, more trusted abroad, and better able to solve pressing global problems like climate change. This book&nbsp;shows citizens, consumers and leaders how we can act together today to create a more united human future<em>. </em></p><p><br><strong>Leif Wenar</strong> holds the Chair of Philosophy and Law at King's College London. He earned his degrees in Philosophy from Stanford and from Harvard, where he worked with John Rawls and with Robert Nozick. He has been a Visiting Professor at Princeton and at Stanford, and has been a Fellow of the Carnegie Council Program in Justice and the World Economy.<br><br>"Philosophers rarely write big books that could change the world, but <em>Blood Oil</em> is such a book. Wenar does not shy away from the horrific consequences of current trade practices, nor from the philosophical arguments needed to show that this trade rests on ethically indefensible assumptions. Yet instead of leaving us to despair, he offers realistic ways of bringing about change that would make the world a better and fairer place." <strong>--Peter Singer, Princeton University, author of </strong><strong><em>One World</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>The Most Good You Can Do</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"Have you ever worried that your spending might be supporting the 'sociopathic rulers and sadistic militias' that blight so many countries in Africa and around the world? Or that your purchases of oil are supporting injustice and oppression, just as British purchases of sugar once supported the enslavement of Africans? Leif Wenar has written the indispensable guide, combining politics, economics, and ethics to tell us just how and why we are all involved, and what we ought to do to make the world a better place." <strong>--Angus Deaton, Princeton University, 2015 Nobel Prize Winner in Economics,</strong> <strong>and author of </strong><strong><em>The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"This book is one of those rare manifestos that awaken people to a pressing ethical issue by changing the way they see the world. Whether or not its recommendations are practicable today, <em>Blood Oil</em> is a fantastically stimulating read: analytic, informative, rationally optimistic, and written with erudition and panache." <strong>--Steven Pinker, Harvard University, author of </strong><strong><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>How the Mind Works</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"Leif Wenar's objective is to devise ways in which the vicious circle at heart of many development failures can be broken, so that odious regimes can be prevented from appropriating natural resources to their own advantage and saddling future generation with much diminished national wealth. Most importantly the book derives practical proposals on how such objectives are to be achieved. The book's conclusions will be of great interest to all those working in international development, and particularly to national governments and international organizations." <strong>--Branko Milanovic, CUNY Graduate</strong> <strong>School, former World Bank Lead Economist, Author of </strong><strong><em>Worlds Apart and The Haves and the Have-Nots</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"It is time that we woke up to the fact that the level of our dependence on certain resources means that we let ourselves be blackmailed by tyrants. Our comfort is purchased by collusion with regimes that are responsible for high levels of human misery, injustice and bigotry. This courageous and forceful book challenges us to make the hard decision that might change this worsening situation. It is a serious and urgent appeal to the conscience of the West." <strong>--Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury and Leader of the Anglican Communion</strong><p></p><br>"<em>Blood Oil</em> is an inspiring book. It will make you think differently about everything you buy- from cell phones to children's toys- and make you realize just how complicit we have become in the rights-crushing autocracies that produce the raw materials from which these everyday products are made. But <em>Blood Oil</em> also lays out, in careful detail, a clean trade strategy that will bring our complicity to an end and help poor people recover sovereignty over their resources. It is also a delight to read: free of jargon and ideology, an engaging, ironic and eloquent tour de force of moral passion." <strong>--Michael Ignatieff, Harvard University, author of </strong><strong><em>The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"This is a long-awaited study of power in the contemporary world, in oil markets and the often corrupted power-plays that they engender. Leif Wenar is a philosopher with profound understanding of the daily, practical world. His big book should become required reading." <strong>--Lord Carlile of Berriew,</strong> <strong>Independent Reviewer of UK Terrorism Legislation 2001-11</strong><p></p><br>"As consumers we depend every day on global supply chains tainted by exploitation and injustice. Leif Wenar's detailed and incisive study of the trade in oil and other "blood" resources, and of its moral and legal background, is the most sustained analysis yet of the responsibilities we bear as beneficiaries of the plunder of authoritarians and kleptocrats. Not everyone will agree with Wenar's moral arguments and policy recommendations but anyone who reads this book will see the urgency of the problem." <strong>--Charles Beitz, Princeton University, author of </strong><strong><em>Political Theory and International</em></strong> <strong></strong><strong><em>Relations</em></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><em>The Idea of Human Rights</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"Leif Wenar puts the oldest principles of ownership and justice to new use in his attack on the human disaster that is the notorious 'resource curse.' His proposal is original, exact, and morally admirable. It should stir us away from the coldly comforting idea that some peoples will always be poor and tyrannically governed. This is a fine marriage of moral seriousness and institutional imagination." <strong>--Jedediah Purdy, Duke University, author of </strong><strong><em>For Common Things and After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"'Telling the person in the seat next to you that you are interested in philosophy,' observes Leif Wenar, 'will often result in an uninterrupted flight.' This lively book gives strong evidence that interruption is sometimes a wise course of action. Writing in an engaging, conversational style, Wenar trenchantly and provocatively explores one of the great moral challenges of our time. Although the benefits from development and global connectedness-in which we are all inescapably complicit-have been huge, some of those benefits have flowed to people who have systematically made the lives of others desperate and miserable." <strong>--John Mueller, Ohio State University and the Cato Institute, co-author of </strong><strong><em>Chasing Ghosts: The Policing of Terrorism</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"<em>Blood Oil</em> is a brilliant inquiry into ethical implications of our dependence on the petroleum trade-and the uncomfortable fact that it fuels many violent conflicts and funds a large fraction of the world's autocrats. Wenar shows that much of this oil has been stolen from the citizens who rightfully own it, nests this issue in the historic struggle for the right of self-determination, and suggests a way to rectify this injustice that is surprisingly practical. This book is not merely a major scholarly achievement; it is both politically urgent and compulsively readable." <strong>--Michael Ross, UCLA,</strong> <strong>author of </strong><strong><em>The Oil Curse: How Petroleum Wealth Shapes the Development of Nations</em></strong><strong></strong><p></p><br>"LOOK at the tablet or the paper that you are reading. Its making will probably involve oil, minerals or metals. Some of those resources will have come from a country whose government steals from and oppresses its citizens. By one estimate, almost 10% of what the average American household spends on petrol each year goes directly into the coffers of such regimes. This is a nasty, if familiar, thought. But Leif Wenar, a philosopher at King's College London, pushes these ideas further, with uncomfortable consequences . . . In jargon-free prose, Mr Wenar argues persuasively that Western consumers are blinded to the fact that international trade still operates according to the 'law of the jungle' . . .He reveals a horrible truth: that global free trade is, at times, bound up in blood." --<strong></strong><strong><em>The Economist</em></strong><strong></strong> <br><p></p><br>"Leif Wenar's <em>Blood Oil</em> prompts us all to think a little more closely about the terrible side effects of oil production and about the role that our own consumption plays in that cycle . . . by putting a human face on the 'resource curse' - a discussion which is too often confined to dry academic and statistical texts - the book's central contribution is in forcing us to confront our own role in enabling the damaging domestic and international effects of oil production. For those who think that the only tie between oil and U.S. foreign policy is the question of energy security, this book offers a valuable corrective. For that alone, it is well worth reading." --<em>War on the Rocks</em><p></p><br>"Informative, thoughtful, exceptionally well organized and presented, thoroughly researched and impressively argued from beginning to end...Very highly recommended." --Midwest Book Review<p></p><br></p><h2>The Selfish Giant &amp; Other Classic Tales: Six Illustrated Stories By Oscar Wilde</h2><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Oscar Wilde's stories for children include poignant tales of love, loss, riches, hope and happiness - specially retold with sumptuous illustrations.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p></p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Military SF and Space Opera (1) (BAEN)</h2><p>The Year&#x2019;s Best of Military&nbsp;SF and Space Opera Stories.&nbsp; Book One of a new Series featuring the best &nbsp;stories of the year from the top magazine and online venues with a military and adventure science fiction theme. &nbsp;PLUS: Interactive Reader Voting for Best Story in Collection!

Because instructors often express the difficulty of creating an active learning environment, this text offers an active, not passive, way for students to learn management skills by challenging students to be self-reflective and asking them to complete numerous assessments, exercises, cases, and other activities. The authors also address another major concern instructors have about students being visual learners by providing a unique Visualize the Skill section not found in any other text. To better enable students to learn about management, chapters are organized in an easy-to-follow format that contains: Assessing Your Skills (pre-assessment scales); Learning About the Skills (concept portion of the text); Practicing Your Skills (exercises); Using Your Skills (case analysis); Extending Your Skills (group and individual exercises); Visualizing the Skills (video exercises); Your Skills Now (assessing skills after working through the chapter); and Interpretations (scoring keys and comparison data).</p><p>Dr. Ricky W.

In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, and big government were not the only reasons for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, a combination of population shifts, public housing initiatives, economic recession, and urban overdevelopment caused its decline. Yet she also proves that ongoing urbanization and neighborhood fluctuations are the very factors that have allowed the Bronx to undergo one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history. The process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.</p></p><p><p>Evelyn Gonzalez is associate professor of history at William Paterson University in New Jersey.</p>The title is misleading: Gonzalez is really focused on the South Bronx--its history, decline and fall, and rise. (She doesn't examine the North Bronx neighborhoods at all.) She recounts in clear if pedestrian prose, based on her own Ph.D. dissertation, the beginnings of the city borough in the mid-nineteenth century when Jordan Mott founded Mott Haven and Lewis Morris the Morrisania villages. Street plans, public transportation (the subway arrived in 1905), and services were created in a city framework, not a suburban one. Waves of immigrant apartment dwellers moved into the Bronx, and into newer and better housing, as the borough grew. But by 1934, with half its housing stock built before the 1901 Tenement House Law, the pattern was set. The South Bronx's wretched housing sheltered wave after wave of poorer and yet poorer immigrants, until it imploded in the 1960s and 1970s. Gonzalez traces its rise again, too, through a workable mixture of public and private, church-related and city-funded initiatives. Suitable for urban-planning and city history collections. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It offers a broad scope of experimental measurement techniques for mechanical and general engineering applications. This text emphasizes the use of uncertainty analysis and statistical data analysis in the estimation of the accuracy of measurements. This sixth edition includes a glossary of data acquisition terms. The scope of the text has been enhanced by expansion of statistical data analysis and general system analysis. Over 100 worked examples and 500 end-of-chapter problems are included, and writing projects have been revised.</p><p></p><h2>Vehicle Accident Analysis and Reconstruction Methods</h2><p>A number of books already exist on the topic of accident reconstruction. With some notable exceptions, many of them are tomes devoted to how the authors and perhaps a few colleagues used intuition and insight to decide how they thought an accident happened. In a few cases, these books are collections of &#34;war stories&#34; or case histories, usually presentations of one view of the events. In contrast, this book is one of methods. The perspective taken here is that accident reconstruction is a field of applied science, namely, an application of the principles of science, mathematics, and engineering, and is a quantitative endeavor. The same principles of mathematics, physics, and engineering that allow us to safely race vehicles over 200 mph, build space stations, and navigate the depths of the oceans can be used to reconstruct vehicle accidents. A concerted goal of this book is to raise the analytical level of accident reconstruction practice such that commonly known scientific, engineering, and mathematical methods increasingly become a more common part of the field. Intended for seasoned practitioners and those entering the field of accident reconstruction, the topical coverage is aimed at the problems reconstructionists encounter from day to day and the types of methods used. Readers are guided through a multitude of practical, useful, and informative examples that show how, when, and why many of these problems occur - key requirements for designing safer vehicles, handling insurance claims, and litigating court cases. Representing a significant improvement in the level of quality and rigor in the presentation of reconstruction analytical techniques of light and heavy vehicle crashes, this book is an invaluablereference for consultants, lawyers, engineers, students, vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, police departments and academies, insurance companies, and those involved in the field of accident reconstruction.</p><p></p><h2>Making It Count: The Improvement of Social Research and Theory</h2><p>This title reexamines and reconsiders the model of empirical research underlying most empirical work. The goal is neither a whitewash nor capital punishment, but rather it is to reform and mold empirical research into an activity that contributes as much as possible to a rigorous understanding of society. Without worrying about defining science or even determining the essence of the scientific enterprise, the goal is one that pools together logical thinking and empirically determined information.&nbsp;One of the fundamental issues to be addressed in this volume: Are there questions currently studied that are basically unanswerable even if the investigator had ideal nonexperimental data? If so, what are the alternative questions that can be dealt with successfully by empirical social research, and how should they be approached? In the chapters ahead, it will be important to keep in mind this doctrine of the undoable. Of course, one cannot simply mutter "undoable" when a difficult obstacle is encountered, turn off the computer, and look in the want ads for a new job&#x2014;or at least a new task. Instead, it means considering if there is some inherent logical reason or sociological force that makes certain empirical questions unanswerable. There are four types of undoable questions to consider: those that are inherently impossible; those that are premature; those that are overly complicated; and those that empirical and theoretical knowledge have nullified.</p><p>"Lieberson's arguments cut to the heart of what sociology is and should be, calling for a different approach to the study of social phenomena. . . .

Between 2008 and 2015, the TRC provided opportunities for individuals, families, and communities to share their experiences of residential schools and released several reports based on 7000 survivor statements and five million documents from government, churches, and schools, as well as a solid grounding in secondary sources.<br><br>A Knock on the Door, published in collaboration with the National Research Centre for Truth &amp; Reconciliation, gathers material from the several reports the TRC has produced to present the essential history and legacy of residential schools in a concise and accessible package that includes new materials to help inform and contextualize the journey to reconciliation that Canadians are now embarked upon.<br><br>Survivor and former National Chief of the Assembly First Nations, Phil Fontaine, provides a Foreword, and an Afterword introduces the holdings and opportunities of the National Centre for Truth &amp; Reconciliation, home to the archive of recordings, and documents collected by the TRC. <br><br>As Aim�e Craft writes in the Afterword, knowing the historical backdrop of residential schooling and its legacy is essential to the work of reconciliation.

It is truly a personal odyssey that will open eyes, minds and hearts to invisible gut causes and life-changing consequences for victims of complex autoimmune, inflammatory and digestive disorders.My book will assist you in natural non-drug solutions to heal conditions and repair damage from prescription drugs and years of health depleting dietary choices. It&#39;s surprising how many symptoms stem from leaky gut and toxic liver syndromes. No, leaky gut is not a dinner table topic, but will soon become a household word. This increasingly common disorder is not well known in traditional medicine, rarely tested for, and much less understood. Leaky gut syndrome is the disease of the 21st Century. The gut houses over half the body&#39;s immune and detoxification system, therefore, an unhealthy gut is what holds back many people from ever getting well. It doesn&#39;t matter what your diagnostic label is, if your gut isn&#39;t healthy, your body cannot repair. This syndrome will soon be as widely discussed and written about as colon cancer, menopause, prostate disorders and arthritis.

Brad cleans out his desk, attends a party with a grab-bag present exchange, and leaves school behind for summer fun. Still, it hasn't been a great day for Brad. First he overslept. Then he got a lemonade breakfast bar instead of one of the few with chocolate chips. At the party, his grab-bag present was a toy pony, a <i>girl </i>gift (perhaps because so few boys are in his class). At the arcade, he puts a quarter into a gumball machine, hoping for one of the red ones, but gets white instead. As Brad discovers in this book from the Math Matters series, luck is sometimes a function of probability. Even readers who don't quite get the point will sympathize with Brad's feelings. Those who do will have an inkling that numbers might indicate the difference between having a chance and having a good chance of a desired outcome. Bright, expressive illustrations enhance this story, one of the few that take place on the <i>last</i> day of school. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Using principles derived from prenatal development and from the biopsychiatric work of Wilhelm Reich, David Boadella unfolds a &#39;psychic embryology&#39;. He describes how ways to deepen the therapist&#39;s work with stress and emotional problems can be found-beginning with life in the womb, and crucial drama of birth, as primordial shaping events to our psyche and soma. These ways include the importance of correct breathing, the use of techniques involving eye contact, voice and language, and methods for re-toning muscles and &#39;grounding&#39; posture.

It&#39;s the charming tale of a cat born a witch&#39;s cat but who would much rather be a kitchen cat. While his sister Sootica learns how to ride a broomstick and turn mice into toads, Gobbolino sets out to find a family to care for him and a home of his own. But, Gobbolino is mistrusted wherever he goes, and blamed for mysterious happenings such as the farmer&#39;s milk turning sour, and the orphanage children&#39;s gruel turning into chocolate! After many such adventures, Gobbolino finally finds the home of his dreams.</p><p>Ursula Moray Williams was born on 19 April 1911 at Petersfield, Hampshire, ten minutes after her twin sister, Barbara. She wrote and illustrated over sixty books for children with the most notable being Gobbolino the Witch&#39;s Cat and The Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse. As well as writing, she became involved in local life around the village of Beckford, where she and her family lived, organizing children&#39;s parties, and serving as a magistrate. After her husband&#39;s death in 1974, Ursula Moray Williams remained active, writing, gardening, giving talks and visiting her family in various parts of the world. She died in October 2006.Poor Gobbolino! His mother was Graymalkin, the famous witch&#39;s cat, so naturally he&#39;s expected to be one, too. But he&#39;s different. Instead of green eyes, his are bright blue; instead of a jet black coat, his is tabby with one white boot; instead of being bad, he wants people to love him. In fact, he really wants only to sit by the fire, catch mice, watch the baby and be a kitchen cat. Nigel Lambert creates wild voices for each of the characters Gobbolino meets on his adventures, from the giddy and giggling, to the nasty and hissing. He breathes fresh life into a wonderful, old tale. P.E.F.

During this time many scholars have joined the debate about how best to understand the role of faith in the academy at large and in the special arena of church-related Christian higher education. The notion of faith-informed scholarship has, of course, figured prominently in this conversation. But, argue Douglas and Rhonda Jacobsen, the idea of Christian scholarship itself has been remarkably under-discussed. Most of the literature has assumed a definition of Christian scholarship that is Reformed and evangelical in orientation: a model associated with the phrase "the integration of faith and learning." The authors offer a new definition and analysis of Christian scholarship that respects the insights of different Christian traditions (e.g., Catholic, Lutheran, Anabaptist, Wesleyan, Pentecostal) and that applies to the arts and to professional studies as much as it does to the humanities and the natural and social sciences. The book itself is organized as a conversation. Five chapters by the Jacobsens alternate with four contributed essays that sharpen, illustrate, or complicate the material in the preceding chapters. The goal is both to map the complex terrain of Christian scholarship as it actually exists and to help foster better connections between Christian scholars of differing persuasions and between Christians and the academy as a whole.<br></p><p><br><strong>Douglas Jacobsen</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Church History and Theology at Messiah College and is the author, most recently, of <em>Thinking in the Spirit: Theologies of the Early Pentecostal Movement</em> (2003). <strong>Rhonda Hustedt Jacobsen</strong> is Professor of Psychology and Director of Faculty Development at Messiah College.<br><br>"This ranks as one of the best contributions to the debate<p></p><br>so far. This is a helpful and serious study, which manages<p></p><br>to be constructive as well as realistic. It may be warmly<p></p><br>recommended to any readers who are concerned with the<p></p><br>relationship between their commitment to scholarship and<p></p><br>their commitment to Christianity." --<em>Theology</em><p></p><br>"Clearly, the Jacobsens have succeeded in their goal. They have enlarged the conversation. They have raised questions, gained clarity on some issues, and provided dialogue from a part of the Christian community that has not spoken so clearly on the subject before. Yet, let us keep the conversation alive." --<em>Calvin Theological Journal</em><p></p><br>"Wise and compelling, fresh and creative, this book helps us think in bold new ways about the relation between Christian faith and secular learning. Mounting a strong critique of the integrationist model that has dominated the conversation about faith and learning in recent years, this book lays out a powerful argument that the work of the Christian scholar is first of all the constructive work of building bridges--bridges that link the life of the mind to the life of the heart, bridges that reach from Christian learning to secular learning, and bridges that tie learning not only to faith, but to hope and love as well. Here is a book to be savored." --Richard T. Hughes, author of <em>How Christian Faith Can Sustain the Life of the Mind</em><p></p><br>"This book will advance and appreciably enlarge the national conversation about the character of Christian scholarship. Its lively 'configural' organization exemplifies what it recommends: creative exchanges among faculty members, each of whom belongs concurrently to multiple communities of belief and discursive practice. The tangled but often productive relationships between religious conviction and open inquiry have seldom been so well displayed and so thoughtfully analyzed."--Mark Schwehn, author of <em>Exiles from Eden: Religion and the Academic Vocation in America</em><p></p><br>"<em>Scholarship and Christian Faith</em> adds rarely heard Anabaptist and evangelical voices to the expanding dialogue about Christian faith, higher education and the intellectual life. The Jacobsens and their friends, whose conversations created this book, are refreshingly realistic, pastoral, and constructive, pushing beyond too easy appeals for integration to confront questions of faith formation, curriculum, and religious practice. Serious, reflective Christians will find this book useful and at times inspiring."--David J. O'Brien, author of <em>From the Heart of the American Church: Catholic</em> <em>Higher Education and American Culture</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Administrative Law Stories</h2><p>This book explores the statutory and historical setting of the cases presented, rather than mere doctrine. It examines lawyers&#x2019; judgments and tactics in detail, and frequently references recently revealed papers of Supreme Court Justices to discuss the often surprising elements of Court decisions. Students learn how disputes are handled at the administrative level, before they ever get to court &#x2013; a perspective essential to understanding the field, but difficult to discern from the reported cases. The commentary also addresses how decisions can affect future developments, helping students understand how administrative disputes develop and the role lawyers play in developing them.</p><p></p><h2>Discourses on Art</h2><p>This standard edition of the Discourses on Art delivered by Sir Joshua Reynolds is now reissued in a new format and with improved illustrations.

A founder of the Wilderness Society in 1935, he carried forward John Muir's battle for conservation.

He is considered the inspiration for the creation of Alaska's eight-million-acre Gates of the Arctic National Park and the one-million-acre Bob Marshall Area in Montana.

The book provides the first full critical discussion of Shakespeare and Wordsworth, explores the influence of the plays on the poetry of Blake and Coleridge, and offers a fresh account of Shakespeare&#39;s powerful presence in the letters and poems of Keats and Byron, and in Shelley&#39;s dramas.

Beginning with the discovery of the oldest complete rug which has been dated to the 5th century BC, the reader is led through the weaving history of the nomadic peoples of Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, the Caucasus and Central Asia, right up to the present day. Each chapter introduces a different group of tribes, their carpets, rugs, kilims and utilitarian bags attributed to their weavers.The book is both a celebration of the woven legacy left by the tribes and a tribute to the skill and artistry of the women who created these wonderful works of tribal art.</p><p>Brian W.

Its cosmic canvas--heaven, hell, chaos, and the Garden of Eden--has enthralled thousands of readers for more than three centuries. For others, however, it has remained an unopened treasure because of the perceived difficulty of its archaic vocabulary and poetic structure. Dennis Danielson's new edition of Milton's great epic offers a vibrant, authoritative rendition in modern prose alongside the original text of Milton's story of heroism, pathos, beauty, and grace, making accessible for the first time a work that continues to be acclaimed as "possibly the most profound meditation on good and evil ever written" (Toronto Globe &amp; Mail, 2000).</p><p><p> John Milton&#x2019;s epic story of cosmic rebellion and the beginning of human history has long been considered one of the greatest and most gripping narratives ever written in English. Yet its intensely poetic language, now-antiquated syntax and vocabulary, and dense allusions to mythical and Biblical figures make it inaccessible to many modern readers. This is, as the critic Harold Bloom wrote in 2000, &#x201c;a great sorrow, and a true cultural loss.&#x201d; </p> <p> Dennis Danielson aims to open up Milton&#x2019;s epic for a twenty-first-century readership by providing a fluid, accessible rendition in contemporary prose alongside the original. The edition allows readers to experience the power of the original poem without barriers to understanding. </p><p> <strong>Dennis Danielson</strong> is Professor of English at the University of British Columbia.

Taking an issues-based approach, it addresses current educational concerns both at home and abroad, and includes analytic frameworks that foster critical thinking and reinforce a systematic method for examination. Biographical sketches add human interest and side-by-side&nbsp;comparisons explore&nbsp;various countries' demographic attributes, geophysical and economic realities, and socio political factors. Because the book focuses on issues instead of countries, it reinforces how and why comparative education is relevant for educators in today&#x2019;s global society. &nbsp;</p></p><p><p> <b><i>Dr. Patricia K. Kubow</i></b> is an Assistant Professor in Educational Foundations and Inquiry at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. Her scholarship is focused on comparative and international education, democratic citizenship education, teacher education, educational policy, and comparative higher education. </p> <p> <b><i>Dr. Paul R. Fossum</i></b> is an Assistant Professor in the School of Education at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. His scholarship is focused on comparative and international education, teacher education, social aspects of education technology, and institutional cooperation in higher education. </p><p> A major purpose of this book is to widen the field of comparative education's influence by articulating the relevance of comparative education to include a larger, practitioner-oriented audience. We believe that the comparative study of education fosters depth of reflection that is not only useful but also necessary for all people engaged in the educative task. At present, however, there are few introductory texts available that acquaint students with comparative education and that equip students with the skills of comparative inquiry to enable systematic exploration of key issues affecting educational policies, practices, and reforms at home and abroad. </p> <p> Over the past 50 years, the field of comparative education has been moving in the direction of examining education-related issues as opposed to educational systems. This focus is a promising direction for the field, because not only does an issues-oriented approach encourage researchers to compare issues that are affecting education worldwide, but it also has relevancy and currency for in-service and preservice educators whose responsibilities are becoming increasingly challenging in light of diverse sociocultural, political, and economic factors shaping the educational landscape at large. </p> <p> In light of globalization, the educational dilemmas that one society faces are often issues of importance in other nations as well. A primary benefit of comparative inquiry is that it causes educators, as well as their students, to widen their conceptual lenses to see how seemingly similar issues manifest themselves in diverse settings. Comparative perspective taking enables us to see the issues anew in our home contexts for the purpose of informing our decision making on those issues. </p> <p><b>THE BOOK'S CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</b></p> <p> This book, then, adopts an issues-oriented approach, emphasizing the comparative perspective. The rationale for a comparative examination of educational issues is to broaden students' views of education and the complex interplay of factors that influence it. The four issues explored here are purposes of schooling, educational access and opportunity, educator accountability and authority, and teacher professionalism. These issues continue to be at the center of public scrutiny and educational debate within and outside the United States. We examine each educational issue in the context of two different countries for purposes of comparison and contrast. </p> <p> The eight countries and regions of study within this text comprise a diverse and broad set but should not be viewed as a representative sampling of all cultures or countries. Rather, the countries and regions selected highlight the complexity and tensions in education and how culture, politics, economics, and social values coalesce to shape ways in which educational issues are interpreted in various settings. A comparative approach, therefore, helps students identify similarities and differences by calling attention to certain aspects of the educational issue within unique national contexts. A benefit of such an approach is that it broadens the scope and context for the examination of education while exposing students to the current comparative literature. These goals are important to students as they sharpen analysis of and reflection on their own professional practice. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT</b></p> <p> The text is divided into three parts. Part 1, titled "<i>Comparative Education and Underlying Assumptions About Education: The Comparative Approach,</i>" consists of two chapters. In Chapter 1, "<i>Comparative Education,</i>" we introduce students to the field of comparative education and the field's development and usefulness, and in Chapter 2, "<i>Theory in Comparative Education,</i>" we discuss prevailing theoretical bases that comparative educators have used to interpret educational policies and practices. </p> <p> In Part 2, titled "<i>Education in International Context: A Comparative Approach Applied to Contemporary Educational Issues,</i>" we examine the four selected issues, each in relation to two different countries to foster comparative perspective taking. Chapter 3 undertakes the question of how diverse purposes of schooling shape educational curriculum in Hong Kong and Israel. In Chapter 4, we examine challenges to educational access and opportunity in Brazil and South Africa. In Chapter 5 we explore the changing relationship between education and the state and how this affects education accountability and authority in England and Germany. The focus of Chapter 6 is upon different orientations to the issue of teacher professionalism and the ways these perspectives affect teacher autonomy and professional development in Japan and the United States. </p> <p> Part 3, titled "<i>Interpreting Educational Issues: Comparison and the Use of Analytic Frameworks,</i>" consists of two chapters. In Chapter 7, "<i>Applying Frameworks to Analyze Educational Issues,</i>" we encourage students to use frameworks, drawn from diverse disciplines, for systematic investigation and analysis of educational issues. The chapter provides a brief summary of the four frameworks discussed previously in the text. We place the frameworks in graphic organizers with questions to stimulate further thinking. Our purpose in this chapter is to suggest how the frameworks, whose usefulness is demonstrated throughout the entire text, are also effective in helping students consider issues in domestic and localized contexts. Instructors might want to use Chapter 7 earlier in the term to introduce students to each framework prior to their reading of the issue-oriented chapters and/or to generate student assignments. Finally, Chapter 8, "<i>The Value of Comparative Education,</i>" summarizes benefits of comparative perspective taking and an issues orientation for the field. An innate feature of an issue is that there is a plurality of responses. Because multiple responses are possible for any given question or situation, answers to questions undertaken yield ambiguous responses. Teachers and teacher educators need to be able to recognize these ambiguities and become comfortable enough to move ahead in their practice. </p> <p><b>FEATURES OF THE TEXT</b></p> <p> To help students view these educational issues in their complexity and to aid in-depth reflection, we use specific <b>analytic frameworks</b> to study the educational issues and provide students with a systematic method for examination. The frameworks emerge from diverse disciplines and fields (e.g., political science, educational policy, sociology) and can be applied to other issues of interest to the reader in order to foster critical thinking-the suspension of judgment in order to draw on multiple perspectives. This leads to better understanding of factors affecting the educational issue or phenomenon being studied and to better informed educational reform efforts. The goal is for students to see that education can be better understood when viewed from multiple perspectives and disciplines. </p> <p> Each chapter includes various pedagogical features, including focusing and closing questions. The "<b>Focusing Questions</b>" at the beginning of each chapter serve to identify the particular aspects of the issue to be addressed in the chapter, and the closing statements, termed "<b>Sustaining Reflection,</b>" that appear at the end of each chapter serve as launching points for further reflection. The book's glossary identifies key terms and definitions that students using a comparative approach should be familiar with and that will aid their understanding of the issues presented. </p> <p> The text also has a number of special features, including boldface terms and boxed features. In each chapter, key terms appear in boldface with their accompanying definitions. <b>Biographical sketches</b> of historical and contemporary comparative educators are featured throughout the text. These help to familiarize students with three international and three American comparative educators who have used international perspectives to guide domestic educational efforts, providing new perspectives on sometimes familiar individuals. "<b>Points of Convergence,</b>" another boxed feature, appear in the issues chapters within Part 2 and provide readers with side-by-side comparisons of featured countries, with respect to such things as their demographic, geophysical, and sociopolitical factors. </p> <p> In summary, this text seeks to (I) broaden the scope and context for examining educational issues through an international comparative approach; (2) increase understanding by examining underlying assumptions of education policies, practices, and reforms; (3) encourage multiple perspective taking by viewing educational issues in light of diverse cultural and historical contexts and through interdisciplinary lenses; and (4) employ specific analytic frameworks to "see" educational issues in new ways. The overall goal of these approaches and features is to foster comparative and critical thinking to better inform educational reform efforts. </p> <p> We hope that professors, teacher practitioners, teacher educators, curriculum developers, and school administrators find that this book stimulates reflection and helps to inform their own personal and professional decision making. </p></p><h2>Tigers of the Snow and Other Virtual Sherpas</h2><p><p>Sherpas are portrayed by Westerners as heroic mountain guides, or "tigers of the snow," as Buddhist adepts, and as a people in touch with intimate ways of life that seem no longer available in the Western world. In this book, Vincanne Adams explores how attempts to characterize an "authentic" Sherpa are complicated by Western fascination with Sherpas and by the Sherpas' desires to live up to Western portrayals of them. Noting that diplomatic aides at world summit meetings go by the name "Sherpa," as do a van in the U.K. built for rough terrain and a software product from Silicon Valley, Adams examines the "authenticating" effects of this mobile signifier on a community of Himalayan Sherpas who live at the base of Mount Everest, Nepal, and its "deauthenticating" effects on anthropological representation.</p><p>This book speaks not only to anthropologists concerned with ethnographic portrayals of Otherness but also to those working in cultural studies who are concerned with ethnographically grounded analyses of representations. Throughout Adams illustrates how one might undertake an ethnography of transnationally produced subjects by using the notion of "virtual" identities. In a manner informed by both Buddhism and shamanism, virtual Sherpas are always both real and distilled reflections of the desires that produce them.</p></p><p><b>Vincanne Adams</b> is Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Princeton University."Adams's book promises to be a provocative if not controversial contribution to the field of Himalayan Studies; it should also stir debate among those concerned with ethnography, cultural studies, [and] identity construction."
